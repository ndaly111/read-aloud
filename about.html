  <h1>About Read‑Aloud</h1>
  <p class="lead">Read‑Aloud is a privacy-first text-to-speech tool built to help people listen to the words they already have. Here is why it exists, how it is funded, and what is coming next.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Why this exists</h2>
    <p>
      Read‑Aloud started as a personal project to make browser-based speech less clunky. Many tools
      required extensions, cloud logins, or copy-pasting into a separate desktop app. I wanted
      something that opened in one tab, respected privacy, and worked across school laptops and locked
      down work machines. The first version was a bare textarea with Start and Stop buttons. The
      progress meter, keyboard shortcuts, and voice filters came later based on the problems users
      were actually hitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mission is simple: let people listen to their own text without friction. That means using the
      system voices they already trust, keeping pages lightweight for readers on slow networks, and
      writing documentation that teaches practical workflows—not just marketing copy. The guides are
      written with real use cases (students cramming, writers editing, readers with ADHD pacing their
      day) so new visitors can immediately see where the tool fits in.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How it stays online</h2>
    <p>
      Read‑Aloud is free to use. Hosting and maintenance costs are covered by a mix of lightweight ads
      on informational pages, small affiliate commissions from optional <a href="recommendations.html" rel="sponsored nofollow">reading accessories</a>, and voluntary tips from people who find the tool helpful. Ads are deliberately disabled on the <a href="app.html">Tool</a> itself to keep user-pasted text separate from ad code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operating costs include hosting the site, monitoring browser API changes, and testing across
      multiple devices. When costs exceed monthly donations, I cover the difference so the experience
      stays stable. If you want to support the project, sharing the guides with classmates or
      colleagues is just as valuable as financial support—it helps reach the people who need the tool
      most.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">Roadmap and planned features</h2>
    <p>
      The roadmap focuses on clarity, speed, and privacy. Here is what is actively being explored:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Session memory:</strong> Remembering your last speed and language per device so you can resume faster without storing text.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved mobile controls:</strong> Larger buttons and accessible spacing for one-handed playback on phones.</li>
      <li><strong>Inline highlighting:</strong> Optional word highlighting during playback for readers who like visual tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Guided checklists:</strong> Built-in presets based on the <a href="guides/tts-study-loop-templates.html">study loop templates</a> so students can start a timed listening sprint with one tap.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice notes:</strong> A short text note field beside the player so writers can mark sentences without switching tabs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have a use case that is not covered here, let me know through the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>. Feedback from students, writers, and accessibility advocates directly shapes what ships next.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0">How to follow updates</h2>
    <p>
      Major changes are summarized on the <a href="guides.html">Guides</a> page and inside the tool’s
      sidebar tips. When browsers roll out new speech features, I update the <a href="voices.html">Voice Gallery</a> and the
      <a href="help.html">Help Center</a> with fresh screenshots and steps. If you rely on Read‑Aloud for coursework or client
      work, bookmark those pages so you can skim what changed after each release.
