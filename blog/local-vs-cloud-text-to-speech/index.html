        If you’ve ever pasted something personal into a text‑to‑speech box—an email draft, a doctor’s note, a cover letter, a set of study notes—you’ve probably paused for a second and thought:
        <strong>“Where does this text go?”</strong>
      </p>

    </nav>

  <p>
    That one question matters more than most people realize, because “text‑to‑speech” can mean two very different setups.
  </p>

  <h2 id="two-ways">The two ways text‑to‑speech usually works</h2>

  <h3>1) Local (on‑device / browser‑native)</h3>
  <p>
    Your phone or computer has voices built in. When you press Start, the speech is generated by your device’s speech engine and played through your speakers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In plain terms: <strong>your text doesn’t need to leave your device just to be spoken.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>2) Cloud TTS (server‑generated)</h3>
  <p>
    You paste text, the service sends it to a server, the server generates the audio, and the audio is streamed back to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    In plain terms: <strong>your text leaves your device so a company can turn it into audio.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Cloud can sound amazing. Local can feel simpler and safer. The right choice depends on what you’re reading—and how private it is.
  </p>

  <h2 id="local-by-design">Why Read‑Aloud is “local by design”</h2>

  <p>
    Read‑Aloud (read-aloud.com) is built around local speech. The site does not upload the text you paste into the tool to our servers.
    Speech is generated by your browser/operating system’s speech engine, and the audio plays in your browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s not a slogan; it’s a design decision.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of people use TTS for things that are personal or high‑stakes: school accommodations, work documents, applications, letters, private messages.
    For those use cases, the goal is usually “let me listen now” without creating new privacy headaches.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2 id="when-cloud">When cloud TTS is worth it (and the questions to ask)</h2>

  <p>There are real reasons people choose cloud TTS. The most common ones:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>You want the most natural voice possible.</strong> Some cloud voices sound closer to an audiobook narrator than most built‑in system voices.</li>
    <li><strong>You need a downloadable audio file.</strong> If your goal is an MP3 you can save, send, or move to another device, cloud tools often support that directly.</li>
    <li><strong>You want consistency across devices.</strong> Local voice lists vary by browser and OS. Cloud voice catalogs are usually the same everywhere.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If that’s what you need, cloud might be the right call—especially for non‑sensitive text (public articles, public‑domain books, language practice paragraphs).
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>If the text is private, ask these before you paste:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do you store my text or generated audio?</strong> If yes, for how long?</li>
      <li><strong>Is my text used to train models or “improve the service”?</strong> If the policy is vague, assume the safest interpretation.</li>
      <li><strong>Can I delete what I uploaded?</strong> Is there a clear delete button or process?</li>
      <li><strong>Who else touches the data?</strong> Sub‑processors, contractors, analytics providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Is it encrypted in transit?</strong> It should be HTTPS.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="safety-checklist">Safety checklist before you paste anything sensitive</h2>

  <p>
    Even with a local tool, your privacy can be undone by your environment. Here’s the checklist I recommend (and use myself):
  </p>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>I’m not screen‑sharing (or the shared window doesn’t include the text box).</li>
    <li>I’m not on a shared/public computer.</li>
    <li>I trust the browser extensions installed in this browser (some extensions can read page content).</li>
    <li>The text does not include passwords, 2FA codes, or secret links.</li>
    <li>If it’s sensitive, I paste only the section I need—not the entire document.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Two practical extras that save headaches:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use a “clean” browser profile for TTS (minimal extensions, fewer surprises).</li>
    <li>If you’re trying to figure out whether a voice is truly on‑device, test with airplane mode. If it still speaks, that’s a strong hint the voice isn’t relying on a server connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="no-downloads">Why Read‑Aloud doesn’t offer downloadable audio</h2>

  <p>
    This is one of the most common questions: <strong>“Can you add an MP3 download button?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The short version is: <strong>most system voices don’t give websites an audio file.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Read‑Aloud relies on browser speech synthesis. It’s built for playback: you provide text, the browser speaks it through your device speakers, and you can pause/resume/stop.
    What it does <em>not</em> do is hand the website a clean audio recording (like a WAV/MP3) that can be saved.
  </p>

  <p>
    To reliably create downloadable audio, a site usually needs server‑side TTS (cloud) or a native app with deeper access to audio pipelines.
    Both of those move you away from “local by design.” So Read‑Aloud makes a deliberate trade:
    private, in‑browser listening instead of file export.
  </p>

  <h2 id="decision-rule">The quick decision rule</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose local TTS</strong> when privacy matters, the text is sensitive, and you want something lightweight that speaks right now.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose cloud TTS</strong> when you need an MP3, want the most natural voice possible, or you’re working with text you don’t mind sending off‑device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        If you’re not sure: use both. Cloud for public content, local for private content. It’s a small habit that prevents big regrets.
