  <h1>ADHD-Friendly Focus Routines With Read‑Aloud</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>
    These routines are non-medical habits that pair Read‑Aloud with small environmental tweaks to reduce distractions. The goal is not perfection; it’s building predictable patterns so your attention drifts less. Adjust any step to fit your needs and check in with a professional for clinical questions.
  </p>

  <div class="box"><strong>Reminder:</strong> Keep expectations reasonable. Two focused 20-minute sessions often beat one exhausting 90-minute push.</div>

  <h2>Environment setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Use neutral background noise or low music without lyrics. Headphones help block interruptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual clutter:</strong> Close tabs unrelated to the task. Keep Read‑Aloud and your notes visible, hide social media.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical cues:</strong> Keep a timer and a notepad within reach. Small routines like a cup of water nearby reduce excuses to wander.</li>
    <li><strong>Device choice:</strong> Desktop browsers tend to be more stable. If using mobile, see <a href="/guide-offline-use.html">offline reliability tips</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Listening routines</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start with a 5-minute warmup: paste a short paragraph and listen at 0.95x–1.0x while taking two quick notes.</li>
    <li>Switch to a slightly higher speed (1.05x–1.2x) for main content. Pause every few paragraphs using the <a href="/guide-keyboard-shortcuts.html">shortcut guide</a>.</li>
    <li>After 15–20 minutes, take a 5-minute movement break. Stretch, walk, or do a small chore away from screens.</li>
    <li>Repeat for one more block, then do a brief recap by pasting your notes back into Read‑Aloud to hear them aloud.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>All-day sessions:</strong> Long marathons often backfire. Use the <a href="/guide-study-pomodoro.html">Pomodoro routine</a> to keep work bounded.</li>
    <li><strong>No plan for interruptions:</strong> Keep a sticky note labeled “parking lot” where you jot distracting thoughts instead of opening new tabs.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-relying on one voice:</strong> Switching voices can refresh attention. Combine with the <a href="/guide-best-voice-speed.html">voice tuning guide</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping hydration and movement:</strong> Small physical resets improve focus more than another 10 minutes of strained listening.</li>
    <li><strong>Unclear goals:</strong> Define what “done” means for the next 20 minutes: summarize, annotate, or quiz yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaving alerts on:</strong> Silence non-essential notifications. Even tiny pings can reset your focus clock.</li>
    <li><strong>Forgetting backup plans:</strong> If playback fails, keep a short text chunk ready or switch browsers. See the <a href="/help.html">Help</a> page for quick fixes.</li>
    <li><strong>Working in one location only:</strong> A small change of environment—different chair or lighting—can restart attention when you fade.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sensory and pacing tweaks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temperature and lighting:</strong> Slightly cooler rooms and steady light reduce drowsiness. Avoid flickering or bright backlights.</li>
    <li><strong>Movement micro-breaks:</strong> Add 30 seconds of stretching every 10 minutes during tough sections to reset posture.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio contrast:</strong> Alternate between two voices every other block. The change in tone can reignite attention.</li>
    <li><strong>Task priming:</strong> Before pressing play, write one sentence about why this section matters. Reread it if your mind drifts.</li>
    <li><strong>Timer gradients:</strong> Start with a 10-minute block, then add five minutes each round until you reach your preferred length.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Set a 20-minute timer and paste your first section. Listen at 1.0x and jot two insights.</li>
    <li>Take a 5-minute movement break.</li>
    <li>Start a second 20-minute block at 1.1x. Use headphones and minimize windows.</li>
    <li>Paste your notes into Read‑Aloud and listen once more as a recap.</li>
    <li>Plan the next session: pick the next section and speed before you stop for the day.</li>
    <li>On the following day, replay yesterday’s recap at 0.9x, then continue with new material to rebuild momentum quickly.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Is this medical advice?</strong> No. These are productivity tips. Consult a professional for medical questions.</li>
    <li><strong>What if I can’t finish a block?</strong> Shorten the timer to 10–15 minutes and rebuild gradually.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I use background music?</strong> Yes. Keep it instrumental and quiet. If it distracts you, switch to neutral white noise.</li>
    <li><strong>Does mobile work?</strong> It can. Keep the screen awake and check <a href="/help.html">Help</a> for troubleshooting if playback pauses.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I resume after distractions?</strong> Rewind 20–30 seconds, reread your goal sentence, and restart at a slightly slower speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I combine this with note-taking apps?</strong> Yes. Split your screen with Read‑Aloud and your notes or use a paper notebook to reduce app switching.</li>
    <li><strong>Where can I learn more routines?</strong> Browse <a href="/guides.html">guides</a> like <a href="/guide-study-pomodoro.html">Pomodoro study</a> or <a href="/guide-offline-use.html">offline use</a> to adapt these tips to different environments.</li>
