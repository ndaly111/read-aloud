  <h1>Voice Gallery</h1>
  <p class="lead">Read‑Aloud lists the text-to-speech voices already installed on your device. Here is why lists differ by browser and how to add more voices on every major platform.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Why voice lists look different</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Read‑Aloud uses the Speech Synthesis API built into your browser. That API surfaces the voices
        shipped with your operating system plus any optional packs you have installed. macOS and iOS
        often ship with several natural voices, while some Windows builds include only a handful until
        you add language packs. ChromeOS and many Android devices rely on Google’s system TTS engine,
        which exposes different options depending on region and device manufacturer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser also matters. Chrome and Edge often expose the newest voices first, while Firefox
        may list fewer voices on some platforms. If you switch browsers and see additional options,
        that is expected: each browser filters the system catalog differently. Regardless of the list,
        all playback happens locally—the tool does not stream your text to a cloud engine.

    <h2>How to install or enable voices</h2>
    <div class="grid two-col">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>iOS and iPadOS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open <em>Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content</em> and tap <strong>Voices</strong>.</li>
          <li>Select a language, then download an enhanced voice such as “Siri Voice 4.” Enhanced voices sound more natural but may take longer to download.</li>
          <li>Return to Read‑Aloud and reload the page. The new voice should appear in the list after the download finishes.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>macOS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open <em>System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content</em> and choose <strong>System Voice → Manage Voices</strong>.</li>
          <li>Add the languages and specific voices you want, then allow downloads to complete.</li>
          <li>Restart the browser to refresh the Speech Synthesis catalog.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Windows 10/11</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open <em>Settings → Time &amp; Language → Speech</em> and review the <strong>Manage voices</strong> section.</li>
          <li>Use <strong>Add voices</strong> to install language packs that include TTS voices. Choose voices that match the language you paste most often.</li>
          <li>Restart the browser; Edge and Chrome tend to expose new voices immediately after a reboot.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Android</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open <em>Settings → System → Languages &amp; input → Text-to-speech output</em>.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>Preferred engine</strong> (often Google’s engine) and tap the gear icon to manage installed voices.</li>
          <li>Download offline voice data for the languages you use. Some manufacturers hide voices under “Offline speech recognition.”</li>
          <li>Reopen Read‑Aloud in Chrome. If the voice list is still short, try enabling “Use network voices” in the same settings panel.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>What to do if voices are missing</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        If the list still looks sparse after installing voices, try these quick fixes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Close and reopen the browser. Some platforms only refresh the list on launch.</li>
        <li>Disable battery saver or low-power modes that might pause voice downloads mid-way.</li>
        <li>On desktop, open a private window to rule out extensions blocking the Speech Synthesis API.</li>
        <li>Ensure your system language settings match the voice language you want; mismatched locales sometimes hide voices.</li>
      </ul>
