Long documents have a predictable fate.  
You read them once, maybe twice. You highlight a few lines. You tell yourself you’ll “circle back.” Then the next week hits, and the doc becomes a bookmark you never touch again—until someone asks a question and you vaguely remember the answer is “in that doc somewhere.”  
This is especially common with:  
* strategy notes  
* vendor evaluations  
* research summaries  
* project proposals  
* AI-generated reports (which can be long and easy to forget)  
The issue isn’t that you’re disorganized. It’s that long docs are bad storage for working memory. They’re great for depth, but terrible for retrieval.  
A simple solution is to create an **audio brief**: a short, spoken-friendly version of the doc that you can replay in five minutes. Not a transcript, not a rewrite—more like the message you’d send to a trusted colleague:  
“Here’s the point, here’s what supports it, here’s the risk, here’s what I’d do next.”  
With read‑aloud.com, you don’t need any special setup. You just write the brief as text, paste it, and listen to it whenever you need to reload the context. You can keep a library of briefs in a notes doc and paste whichever one you need that day.  
  
## What an audio brief is (and isn’t)  
An audio brief is not “a summary of everything.”  
It’s the smallest amount of information that lets you:  
* remember the argument  
* explain it to someone else  
* make a decision  
* or take the next step  
If you include every detail, it stops being a brief and becomes homework.  
A good brief sounds like a person who actually read the doc and formed an opinion—not a person reciting the table of contents.  
  
## The 5‑minute brief structure that holds up  
Here’s a structure that works across almost any topic. Keep it tight.  
## 1) Headline (10 seconds)  
One sentence that captures the point.  
* “The recommendation is to pilot Vendor A for 30 days, not sign a one‑year deal yet.”  
## 2) Why now (15 seconds)  
The forcing function.  
* “We need to decide this month because renewal notice is due and procurement lead times are real.”  
## 3) The three key points (2–3 minutes total)  
Three points only. Each point gets:  
* the point  
* one supporting detail (a number, example, or concrete observation)  
This is where most briefs go wrong: people list seven points and none stick.  
## 4) The tradeoff / risk (45 seconds)  
One or two risks, stated plainly.  
* “Risk: the pilot might under-represent peak load. If so, we extend testing before committing.”  
## 5) The decision / next step (30 seconds)  
What you want to happen next, and by when.  
* “Next step: confirm pilot success criteria by Friday; schedule security review next week.”  
## 6) The link list (not spoken, but included)  
At the bottom, paste:  
* the original doc link  
* any key dashboards  
* any supporting emails/tickets  
You don’t need to listen to links. You need them there for retrieval.  
  
## A small example (what this sounds like)  
Let’s say you read a long vendor comparison. A brief might sound like:  
**Headline:** “We should pilot Vendor A before signing, because cost and reliability look good but we don’t yet trust integration effort.”
**Why now:** “Renewal notice is due in three weeks, so we need direction soon.”
**Point 1:** “Cost: Vendor A’s expected annual cost is lower under our current usage assumptions; Vendor B gets expensive with overages.”
**Point 2:** “Reliability: A has clearer uptime terms and incident reporting; B’s SLA is vague.”
**Point 3:** “Integration: A will likely require more work on our side; the doc suggests 2–3 weeks of engineering time.”
**Risk:** “Pilot may miss peak traffic behavior, so we should include a stress test or extend by two weeks if needed.”
**Next step:** “Define pilot success criteria and get security review scheduled by Friday.”  
That’s a brief you can replay before a meeting and sound like you know what’s going on—without re-reading a 12‑page doc.  
  
## Try this on read‑aloud.com  
## The “does this sound like a human?” test  
Paste your brief and listen once.  
A good audio brief has a certain feel: it moves. It makes claims, supports them, names risk, and ends with a next step.  
If it sounds flat, it’s usually because of one of these:  
* **Too many abstract nouns** (“alignment,” “value,” “stakeholders,” “capabilities”)
Replace with concrete terms and outcomes.  
* **No anchors** (no numbers, no examples, no timeframes)
Add one detail per key point.  
* **No opinion**
A brief without a recommendation often turns into “here are some facts.” Facts are fine, but a brief is supposed to help you decide.  
  
## The habit that makes this worth it: keep a brief library  
Create one document called “Briefs.” Each brief gets:  
* Title  
* Date  
* Brief text  
* Links  
That’s it.  
When you have a meeting, you don’t start from scratch. You paste the relevant brief into read‑aloud.com, listen once while you’re making coffee, and you walk in ready.  
It’s also a great way to avoid re-learning the same thing every month. A brief is a memory device you can actually use.  
  
## The template (copy/paste)  
**Title:**
**Date:**  
**Headline:**
**Why now:**  
**Key point 1:** (with one detail)
**Key point 2:** (with one detail)
**Key point 3:** (with one detail)  
**Risk / tradeoff:**
**Decision / next step:** (include date)  
**Links:**

* ☐ Exactly thr
