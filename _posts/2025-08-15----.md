A weekly review is supposed to make you feel lighter.  
In practice, a lot of them do the opposite: you open your notes, scroll through half-finished thoughts, see a pile of tasks that never got done, and end up with that vague Sunday-night pressure—like you forgot something important but can’t name it.  
That feeling isn’t a moral failure. It’s a format problem.  
Most “weekly review” advice assumes your problem is discipline: *just review your tasks and plan next week.* But the real problem is that most of what you have in front of you isn’t decision-ready. It’s scraps:  
* meeting notes with action items buried inside paragraphs  
* TODOs written as topics (“budget,” “deck,” “follow up”)  
* half-commitments you made out loud that never got captured  
* work you did that “counts,” but isn’t visible on a checklist  
Reading that silently is where people get stuck. Your eyes skim and your brain fills in the gaps, so you never fully face what the week actually turned into.  
Listening changes the experience. Audio forces sequence. It makes repetition obvious. It makes vague tasks sound vague. And it surfaces the one thing you’re usually missing at the end of a week:  
**a small set of decisions.**  
Not a longer list. Three decisions.  
  
## The three decisions that actually reset your brain  
A useful weekly review ends with:  
1. **Commit** — what you are genuinely continuing next week  
2. **Commit** — what you are genuinely continuing next week  
3. **Commit** — what you are genuinely continuing next week  
4. **Cut** — what you’re not doing (or not doing *now*)  
5. **Cut** — what you’re not doing (or not doing *now*)  
6. **Cut** — what you’re not doing (or not doing *now*)  
7. **Cut** — what you’re not doing (or not doing *now*)  
8. **Cut** — what you’re not doing (or not doing *now*)  
9. **Clarify** — what’s too vague to execute and needs one concrete next step  
10. **Clarify** — what’s too vague to execute and needs one concrete next step  
11. **Clarify** — what’s too vague to execute and needs one concrete next step  
If you walk away with those three, you’ll feel the difference immediately: fewer open loops, fewer “I’ll get to it” ghosts, fewer surprise deadlines.  
Everything else is detail.  
  
## Why listening helps when reading doesn’t  
When you read your notes, your brain silently edits for you. It replaces “budget” with the full story you already know. It assumes “follow up” has an obvious target. It skips awkward lines like “maybe we should…” because they feel optional.  
When you *hear* it, you’re less able to pretend it’s coherent.  
* “Budget” sounds like nothing.  
* “Follow up” sounds like you’re avoiding the task.  
* The same unresolved issue shows up three times in different words—audio makes that painfully clear.  
* A commitment you made in a meeting (“I’ll send that Monday”) becomes obvious when it’s read back to you.  
This is why a paste-and-listen tool like read‑aloud.com works well for weekly review. You’re not using it for motivation. You’re using it as a mirror.  
  
## Try this on read‑aloud.com (the 10‑minute version)  
Don’t over-engineer it. The point is speed.  
## 1) Make a “week dump” (2 minutes)  
Copy/paste a rough dump of:  
* your meeting notes (or just the “Actions” sections)  
* your task list  
* any quick scratch notes you kept during the week  
You’re not organizing yet. You’re collecting.  
## 2) Listen once straight through (3 minutes)  
Paste the week dump into read‑aloud.com and press Start.  
While it plays, don’t rewrite. Just mark lines with a quick label:  
* **C** = Commit (this is real work that should continue)  
* **X** = Cut (not happening, not now, or not yours)  
* **?** = Clarify (too vague; needs a next step)  
If you only do one thing: **mark the vague items**. Vague items create the most stress because they can’t be finished.  
## 3) Write your “three decisions” list (5 minutes)  
When the audio ends, create three short lists:  
**Commit (next week):** 3–5 items max
**Cut (not doing):** 3–10 items (this is where relief comes from)
**Clarify (next action):** each gets one verb-based next step  
**Commit (next week):** 3–5 items max
**Cut (not doing):** 3–10 items (this is where relief comes from)
**Clarify (next action):** each gets one verb-based next step  
That’s the whole review.  
  
## The Clarify move: turn “topics” into “deliverables”  
Here’s where most people get stuck. They think planning is choosing tasks. But the real move is turning fuzzy topics into deliverables.  
If your task doesn’t have a deliverable, it isn’t a task. It’s a category.  
Examples:  
* “Budget” → “Send revised budget draft to Alex by Tuesday 2pm”  
* “Deck” → “Cut slides 6–10 and rewrite the recommendation slide”  
* “Follow up” → “Email vendor asking for SOC2 + renewal cap language”  
* “Onboarding” → “Write the 5-step ‘first deploy’ lesson for new hires”  
Notice what changed: now you can picture “done.”  
A simple rule: if you can’t attach a file, message, decision, or artifact to the task, it’s probably not shaped enough yet.  
  
## The Cut list is not failure. It’s leadership.  
Here’s a non-obvious takeaway: cutting work is often the most senior part of planning.  
Mid-career work gets messy because your scope expands faster than your calendar. You accumulate “nice to have” responsibilities, favors, optional projects, and “someone should…” ideas.  
If you don’t cut, you end up with a plan that’s quietly dishonest.  
A good Cut list includes:  
* things you’re saying “not this week” to  
* things that should be delegated  
* things that sounded important in the moment but didn’t survive the week  
* things that were never truly yours  
Write it down. If you keep cuts in your head, they haunt you.  
  
## A realistic example: what this looks like in practice  
**Before (week dump snippets):**  
* “Budget — talk to finance”  
* “QBR deck updates”  
* “Follow up with Legal”  
* “Onboarding doc improvements”  
* “Investigate latency issue”  
* “Send notes from Wednesday meeting”  
* “Maybe explore vendor B?”  
This is the kind of list that makes you feel like you worked all week and finished nothing.  
**After (three decisions):**  
**Commit**  
* Send budget draft v2 to Finance + Alex (Tue 2pm)  
* Finish QBR deck: update metrics + tighten recommendation slide (Wed EOD)  
* Investigate latency: reproduce + write short finding summary (Thu)  
**Cut**  
* “Explore vendor B” (park until renewal terms arrive)  
* “Onboarding doc improvements” (reduce to one module; rest later)  
* Extra slide polish on QBR (good enough is fine)  
**Clarify**  
* “Follow up with Legal” → Email Legal with the specific clause + deadline request (Mon 11am)  
* “Send meeting notes” → Post 6-bullet recap with owners + dates in #project-updates (today)  
* “Onboarding doc improvements” → Write ONE 5-minute lesson: “First deploy” (Fri)  
Now you have a week you can actually run. You didn’t magically get more time. You got more clarity.  
  
## The final 60 seconds: create a “next week headline”  
This is optional, but it’s a surprisingly strong anchor:  
Write one sentence that describes what next week is *for*.  
Examples:  
* “Next week is about shipping the QBR narrative and locking renewal terms.”  
* “Next week is about reducing risk on latency before we expand rollout.”  
That sentence prevents the classic failure where Monday starts and you immediately get pulled into random tasks.  
  
## The takeaway  
A weekly review shouldn’t be a guilt ritual. It should be a reset.  
Using text-to-speech for this isn’t a gimmick. It’s a way to stop skimming your own chaos and start hearing it as a sequence. When you hear it, you can’t avoid the truth: some tasks aren’t tasks, some commitments need shaping, and some work needs to be cut.  
Ten minutes. Three decisions. Much less mental noise.
