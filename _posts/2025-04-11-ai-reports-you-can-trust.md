AI-generated reports have a dangerous quality: they often sound “professional” even when they’re wrong.

Not wrong in an obvious way—wrong in a subtle way. A confident sentence with no support. A statistic that seems plausible but has no source. A recommendation that sounds decisive but doesn’t actually connect to the facts above it.

If you’re using AI to draft internal briefs, market summaries, competitor notes, or strategy options, you already know the upside: speed. The downside is reputational. The first time you forward a clean-looking report that contains a quiet error, you’ll wish you’d spent five minutes verifying it.

One surprisingly effective check is to **listen to the report** before you treat it as real. Not because a robot voice is more accurate—but because listening forces you to process the writing in sequence. It becomes harder for contradictions and vague claims to hide in the blur of skimming.

This method works especially well with a simple paste‑and‑play tool like Read‑Aloud: copy, paste, press Start, and audit as you go.

---

**Why listening catches problems your eyes miss**

When you skim, you tend to evaluate tone first:
- “This sounds polished.”
- “This feels structured.”
- “This seems reasonable.”

AI is good at those cues. That’s the problem.

Listening changes the test. You’re no longer judging polish—you’re judging coherence. You can’t jump around. If a paragraph doesn’t connect to the next one, you feel it. If a claim is vague, you hear it as empty.

Think of it like this: **reading is scanning; listening is committing.** Anything that can’t survive real-time delivery is suspect.

---

**The two things you’re auditing**

When you listen to an AI report, you’re checking two separate qualities:
1. **Does it make sense?** (coherence)
2. **Is it supported?** (evidence)

A report can be coherent and still unsupported. It can be supported in parts and still internally inconsistent. You want both.

---

**The workflow: Coherence pass, then Evidence pass**

**Pass 1: Coherence pass (1.0×)**

Paste the first section into Read‑Aloud. Set speed to **1.0×** and press Start.

While it plays, don’t try to “fix” the report. Just tag red flags in the text or in a scratchpad.

Here are the red flags that show up clearly in audio:

**Red flag 1: The “fog sentence”**
You’ll hear a sentence that sounds smart but communicates nothing:
- “This approach enables enhanced outcomes across multiple stakeholder groups.”
If you can’t paraphrase it into plain language immediately, it’s probably fluff.

**Action:** mark it **[fog]** and either delete it or force it to become specific.

**Red flag 2: The “confident leap”**
The report moves from facts to a strong conclusion without showing the bridge:
- “Given these trends, we should immediately switch vendors.”
Listen for the missing step: *why* does this data imply that decision?

**Action:** mark **[leap]** and require a reason or a caveat.

**Red flag 3: Repeated ideas dressed up as new**
AI often rephrases the same point three times, making a report feel longer and more “thorough” than it is.

In audio, repetition is painful. That’s useful.

**Action:** keep the best version and delete the rest.

**Red flag 4: Sudden topic shifts**
If you hear a paragraph that feels like it belongs in another document, it probably does.

**Action:** mark **[off-track]** and cut or relocate it.

---

**Pass 2: Evidence pass (0.9× + visual follow)**

Now slow down to **0.9×** and follow along with the text.

This pass is a hunt for specifics:
- numbers
- dates
- company names
- product names
- citations
- “according to…” statements

Your goal is to separate the report into two piles:
- **claims you can keep**
- **claims that require verification**

Here’s a template that keeps this honest:

**Claim:**
**What it’s based on:** (source/link/data/observation)
**What I need to verify:** (exact check)
**Status:** verified / uncertain / remove

If a claim has no “based on” line, treat it as uncertain by default—especially if it’s central to a decision.

---

**The “numbers and nouns” trick (fast and effective)**

A lot of AI errors live in **numbers and nouns**:
- wrong dates
- wrong product names
- wrong company relationships
- swapped metrics
- “close enough” figures

Do a short pass where you only pay attention to:
- every number
- every proper noun (company, person, product, regulation)
- every absolute claim (“always,” “never,” “the best,” “guarantees”)

Listening at 0.9× while watching the text makes those pop.

If you catch even one shaky detail, assume there are others and tighten your verification step.

---

**How to rewrite AI text into something you can stand behind**

Once you’ve flagged fog and unsupported claims, rewrite using this simple rule:

**Replace certainty with accuracy.**

Examples:
- “This will reduce churn” → “This *may* reduce churn if adoption reaches X.”
- “Competitors are moving aggressively” → “Two competitors announced X in the last Y months.”
- “The market is shifting toward…” → “Recent pricing changes suggest…”

This doesn’t weaken the document. It makes it believable.

And here’s a professional move that prevents embarrassment: add a short “Assumptions” section.

**Assumptions (example):**
- “This summary relies on public information available as of [date].”
- “Any numbers without links should be treated as estimates until verified.”
- “Recommendations assume [constraint].”

That one section signals maturity and protects you when the world changes.

---

**What not to do with AI reports (even if you’re tempted)**
- Don’t forward them as-is because “it’s probably fine.”
- Don’t treat a neat structure as proof of truth.
- Don’t let the report make strong claims without showing sources.
- Don’t let “professional tone” replace verification.

If you’re the person who sends the report, you own it—no one cares that AI wrote the first draft.

---

**The final checklist (the one that saves reputations)**

Before you share an AI-generated report:

☐ I listened once at 1.0× for coherence and flagged fog/leaps/repetition
☐ I listened at 0.9× while following the text for numbers and proper nouns
☐ Every important claim has a “based on” line (source, link, or observation)
☐ Unsupported claims are either verified, softened, or removed
☐ I added a short assumptions/caveats section if this informs decisions
☐ I can defend the report without saying “the model said…”

Used this way, Read‑Aloud isn’t just a convenience tool. It becomes a quality filter: a fast way to turn “polished text” into something you can actually trust before it leaves your laptop.
