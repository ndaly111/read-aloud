Most people rehearse the wrong thing.
They click through slides, glance at speaker notes, nod along, and think, “Yep, I know this.” Then they get in front of an audience and suddenly they’re saying “so…” a lot, explaining the same point twice, and spending four minutes on the first two slides.
It’s not because they don’t know the material. It’s because reading your notes silently is not the same as hearing them spoken. Silent reading is forgiving. Your brain fills gaps, smooths awkward phrasing, and skips over spots that would sound clunky out loud.
A simple way to fix this—without fancy tools—is to run your speaker notes through a text‑to‑speech pass. Not to “robot‑read” your talk, but to surface where your notes don’t behave like speech.
If you use Read‑Aloud, the workflow is brutally simple: copy your speaker notes → paste → press Start. That simplicity is an advantage. You can do this five times in ten minutes and actually improve the talk.
The real reason notes that “look fine” sound bad
Speaker notes often fail in predictable ways:
- They’re written like documentation, not speech.
- They rely on the slide for context (“As you can see here…”).
- They pack multiple ideas into one sentence because it looks tidy.
- They spend too long warming up before stating the point.
- They bury the “so what” behind setup.
On a screen, you can skim, jump, and re‑read. A listener can’t. If your message isn’t easy to follow in real time, people drift—even if they respect you and care about the topic.
### Step 0: Make a “listening version” of your speaker notes
You’re not rewriting your deck. You’re making a temporary copy of your notes that’s optimized for listening.
Before you paste anything into Read‑Aloud:
1. Remove slide-dependent language
- Delete: “As you can see on this chart…”
- Replace with: “The trend is simple: costs rise in Q3, then stabilize.”
2. Make one line = one thought
This sounds small, but it’s huge for listening. You want natural “breath breaks.”
3. Add simple signposts
These are not cheesy. They are kindness.
- “Here’s the headline: …”
- “The reason this matters: …”
- “What we’re going to do about it: …”
- “The decision I’m asking for: …”
4. Mark optional details
Put extra detail in parentheses so you know it’s “if time.”
Now you’re ready to listen.

### Pass 1: The Eyes‑Off Story Test (1.0×)
Paste one section of notes (don’t paste the entire talk at once), set speed to 1.0×, press Start, and do your best to not stare at the text.
Your only goal in this pass is to answer one question:
If someone heard this without slides, would it make sense?
Pause only to drop quick markers into your notes like:
- [confusing]
- [too long]
- [missing why]
- [sounds defensive]
- [needs example]
What usually shows up in Pass 1
1. You don’t say what the point is soon enough
A professional audience is impatient in a specific way: they’re not rude, but they’re busy. If you spend two minutes “setting context” before stating your point, you’ll feel it during the listen. Your brain will start asking, “Where is this going?”
Fix: lead with the takeaway, then earn it.
A strong opening can be as plain as:
- “I’m here to get a decision on X.”
- “I’m going to show you why Y is slipping and what we can do this week.”
- “The goal today is alignment: one plan, one owner, one date.”
2. Your transitions are missing
Slides can hide transition problems. Audio exposes them. You’ll hear a topic jump that feels like stepping off a curb you didn’t see.
Fix: add a bridge sentence:
- “Now that you’ve seen the problem, here’s the constraint.”
- “With that context, here are the options.”
- “Before the recommendation, one risk to keep in mind…”
3. Numbers float by without anchors
“Revenue was 17% higher” is meaningless unless you say compared to what, and why it matters.
Fix: give numbers a job:
- “This number matters because it changes our staffing plan.”
- “This is the difference between hitting the target and missing it.”
4. You accidentally sound unsure
Not because you are unsure, but because your notes are full of softeners: “kind of,” “maybe,” “I think,” “hopefully.”
Fix: keep accuracy, drop the wobble. You can be careful without sounding uncertain:
- “The current data suggests…”
- “Our best estimate is…”
- “Based on the last three weeks…”

### Pass 2: The Delivery Cleanup (0.9× + light visual follow)
Now set speed to 0.9×. Follow the text while it plays. This pass is about tightening the phrases you’d trip over if you tried to say them out loud.
Here’s what to listen for.
1. Sentences that are fine on paper but hard to speak
If you hear yourself getting mentally lost mid-sentence, the audience will too.
Fix: split it. Don’t fight the sentence—break it into two.
2. “Throat-clearing” openings
These waste time and make your message feel hesitant:
- “So, what I wanted to talk about today is…”
- “I just wanted to quickly share…”
- “I think we should maybe…”
Replace with something direct:
- “Today’s goal is…”
- “The update is…”
- “My recommendation is…”
3. Hidden jargon you don’t realize you’re using
Every field has phrases that feel normal internally but land poorly in a mixed audience. Listening makes this obvious because the words sound like fog.
Fix: swap one abstract noun for a concrete verb:
- “Enable” → “make it possible to”
- “Alignment” → “agree on a plan”
- “Prioritize” → “do first”
You don’t need to sanitize your vocabulary. Just remove the words that don’t actually carry information.
4. Repetition you can’t see anymore
When you’ve revised a deck a lot, you start repeating yourself without noticing. Audio makes repetition painful (in a useful way).
Fix: pick one best sentence and delete the runner‑ups.

## Timing without a stopwatch obsession
You don’t need to micromanage minutes, but you do need to avoid the classic trap: spending half your time before you reach your ask.
A practical way to use Read‑Aloud for pacing:
- Break the talk into chunks (opening, problem, options, recommendation, close).
- Listen to each chunk and jot a rough time estimate.
- If the opening chunk is long, shorten it first. That’s the highest return cut.
A simple rule that improves almost every talk:
Say the ask earlier than feels comfortable.
Not because you’re pushy, but because it gives the audience a frame for everything else.

## The “speaker notes that sound like a person” template
If your notes tend to balloon, try writing them in this structure:
1. Headline (one sentence):
## “Here’s the takeaway: ___.”
2. Why it matters (one sentence):
“This matters because ___.”
3. Evidence (2–3 bullets):
“First… Second… Third…”
4. Decision / next step (one sentence):
“What I’m asking for today is ___ by ___.”
5. If time (optional detail):
“One risk to flag is ___.”
Paste that into Read‑Aloud and listen. If it sounds clean, you’re in good shape.

## Make Read‑Aloud part of the rehearsal loop
A polished delivery isn’t about memorizing. It’s about removing the parts that create friction—so your thinking comes through.
The loop looks like this:
1. Copy one section of notes
2. Paste into Read‑Aloud
3. Listen once at 1.0× (story)
4. Tighten the confusing spots
5. Listen at 0.9× (delivery)
6. Move to the next section
Ten minutes of this can do more for a presentation than an hour of clicking through slides, because you’re rehearsing what the audience actually experiences: your words, in order, at speed.
