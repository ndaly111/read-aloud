Most negotiations don’t fail because the other side is unreasonable.  
They fail because your position is blurry.  
You go in with a feeling (“I’m underpaid,” “this timeline is unrealistic,” “this vendor is expensive,” “this scope is too big”) and you assume you’ll “figure it out live.” Then the conversation drifts into details, tone, and side debates. You leave with a half‑commitment, a “we’ll see,” or a concession you didn’t mean to make—because you didn’t decide your boundaries ahead of time.  
A negotiation is not an improv scene. It’s closer to a short speech with a handful of terms.  
If you want a practical edge, the move is simple: write a **one‑page ask** that you can say out loud without cringing, rambling, or sounding apologetic. That page is not a script. It’s a clarity tool. It forces you to decide what you want, what you’re willing to give, and what you’ll do if you don’t get it.  
And this is where text‑to‑speech helps in a way that’s surprisingly effective: when you *hear* your ask, you notice where it’s weak. You’ll catch the “I was kind of hoping…” language. You’ll hear when your request sounds like a complaint instead of a proposal. You’ll hear when you buried your number under three paragraphs of context.  
  
## The one-page ask: what it is (and what it isn’t)  
It is:  
* one page you could hand to a colleague and they’d understand your position in 60 seconds  
* the terms you’re trying to land, plus the logic and boundaries behind them  
* a way to avoid negotiating from emotion or improvisation  
It isn’t:  
* a legal document  
* a rant  
* a list of every grievance  
* a pile of “reasons” meant to win an argument  
The point is to make your request **easy to evaluate**. People say yes faster when they understand what yes means.  
  
## The One‑Page Ask Template  
Use this exactly as written the first time. You can refine later.  
## 1) What’s the decision we’re making?  
One sentence, plain language.  
* “We’re deciding whether my role and comp should be adjusted this cycle.”  
* “We’re deciding whether this project can ship by May 15 without cutting scope.”  
* “We’re deciding whether we renew this vendor under the proposed terms.”  
## 2) My ask (the terms)  
Write the ask like a term sheet. Not poetry.  
* “I’m asking for: Base $X, bonus Y, title Z.”  
* “I’m asking for: one additional engineer for 8 weeks, or we remove Feature B from the milestone.”  
* “I’m asking for: a 12‑month term, renewal cap, and a defined overage policy.”  
## 3) The basis (your evidence in 3 bullets)  
Not “because I work hard.” Proof that connects to outcomes.  
* Revenue impact, cost saved, incidents reduced, cycle time improved  
* scope growth and responsibilities that moved beyond original role  
* market comps (if you have them)  
* risk reduction (especially if you carry the risk)  
Keep it to three bullets. More than that looks like insecurity.  
## 4) Constraints (what’s true whether we like it or not)  
This is where you sound mature. Constraints reduce drama.  
* budget cycle timing  
* hiring freeze  
* contractual limits  
* launch date commitments  
* dependency constraints  
If you name constraints upfront, you don’t waste time pretending they aren’t real.  
## 5) What I can give (the trade)  
A negotiation is almost always a trade. State what you’re offering.  
* “I can commit to owning X end‑to‑end.”  
* “I can move fast on Y if we cut Z.”  
* “We can sign this quarter if renewal is capped and usage is defined.”  
This is where you stop sounding like you’re “asking for a favor” and start sounding like you’re proposing a deal.  
## 6) My fallback ladder (if you can’t meet the ask)  
This is the part people skip—and the part that prevents regret.  
Write 2–3 fallbacks in order:  
* If you can’t do A, then B.  
* If you can’t do B, then C.  
* If you can’t do C, then I’m choosing D.  
This doesn’t have to be a threat. It’s clarity.  
Example (comp negotiation):  
* A: “Adjust base to $X.”  
* B: “If base can’t move, add a sign-on/retention bonus of $Y.”  
* C: “If comp can’t change this cycle, confirm a written path: title change + comp review date in 90 days with criteria.”  
* D: “If we can’t commit to that, I’ll need to reassess what I take on going forward.”  
Example (timeline/scope negotiation):  
* A: “Ship by May 15 with Feature A and B.”  
* B: “Ship by May 15 with Feature A only.”  
* C: “Ship by June 1 with A and B.”  
* D: “If none of those work, we pause and re-plan with leadership.”  
Notice the key: your ladder turns “no” into a set of choices instead of a dead end.  
## 7) The close  
End with one clean question:  
* “Which option can we commit to today?”  
* “What would you need to see to agree to this?”  
* “If we can’t do this, what can we do—and by when can we confirm it?”  
  
## Try this on read‑aloud.com (quick, not precious)  
Paste only:  
* the decision sentence  
* your ask  
* your fallback ladder  
* your closing question  
Press Start and listen once.  
You’re listening for two things:  
1. **Does it sound like a deal, or does it sound like venting?**
If it sounds like venting, move your basis into bullets and tighten your ask.

1. **Do you sound like you’re asking permission to have a position?**
If your draft is full of “I was kind of thinking…” or “maybe…” or “if possible…”—rewrite in plain language:

* “I’m asking for…”  
* “My recommendation is…”  
* “The cleanest option is…”  
You can be respectful without being mushy.  
  
## The calm sentence bank (use when the room gets weird)  
Negotiations get tense because people start reading intent into words. These lines keep you steady without sounding robotic:  
* “Let’s separate what we want from what’s possible this cycle.”  
* “I’m not trying to win a debate here—I’m trying to land a workable agreement.”  
* “If we can’t do X, I’m open to Y. What’s realistic?”  
* “What would make this a yes?”  
* “If the answer is no, that’s okay. I just want clarity on what the alternative is.”  
The last one is powerful. It removes the emotional guessing game.  
  
## A final point most people miss: write down what you’ll do if you don’t get it  
This is not about ultimatums. It’s about self-respect and planning.  
If you don’t decide in advance what “no” means for you, you’ll drift into resentment. If you *do* decide, you’ll act with less heat and more clarity.  
That decision might be:  
* you stop taking on extra scope without a change in role  
* you renegotiate the timeline publicly  
* you run a pilot instead of a full rollout  
* you revisit comp at a specific date with criteria  
* you walk away from a vendor deal  
You don’t need to announce it. But you should know it.  
A one-page ask turns negotiation from a stressful conversation into something cleaner: terms, tradeoffs, and a decision.
