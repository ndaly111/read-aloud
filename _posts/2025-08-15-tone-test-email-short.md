## The Tone Test: Listen to Your Email Before You Send It (and Avoid the Thread)
If you’ve been in professional work long enough, you’ve seen it: a small email that should have taken two minutes to resolve turns into an ugly thread. Not because anyone is incompetent. Because tone gets misread, intent gets guessed, and people start defending themselves instead of solving the problem.
Here’s the uncomfortable part: the email usually looked “fine” to the sender. They weren’t trying to be sharp. They were trying to be efficient.
Silent reading makes that easy to miss. Your brain hears your intent. The reader hears your words. Those are not the same thing.
Listening to your message—even with a simple text‑to‑speech voice—creates distance. It lets you hear what you actually wrote, not what you meant.
Why listening works when re-reading doesn’t
When you re-read your own draft, you’re reading it through your internal voice. That voice has context: your mood, your relationship with the recipient, the entire backstory.
Audio strips that away. You hear the text in a neutral delivery. And suddenly, tiny issues pop out:
- Your ask is buried.
- You sound annoyed even if you weren’t.
- You’re over-explaining (which can read as anxious or political).
- You’re under-explaining (which can read as dismissive).
- You’ve accidentally written a sentence that sounds like blame.
None of those problems are “grammar problems.” They’re relationship problems. And they’re expensive.
