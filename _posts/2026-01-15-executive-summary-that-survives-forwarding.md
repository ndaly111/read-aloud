An executive summary has one job: **make the reader smarter in under a minute**.  
Not entertained. Not impressed. Smarter.  
The problem is that many summaries fall into one of two traps:  
1. **They’re so vague they’re meaningless.**
“Progress is strong and we’re tracking well.”
Okay—tracking toward what? What changed? What should someone do?  
1. **They’re confident in a way that creates future pain.**
“Customers love this.” “This will reduce churn.” “This approach is best.”
Maybe. But if that sentence gets forwarded and quoted, you’ve now created a claim you might have to defend.  
A summary that survives forwarding does something rare: it’s specific without overselling. It tells the truth at the right resolution.  
Text‑to‑speech is helpful here because executives and busy leaders don’t read like you do. They scan, they skim, they mentally paraphrase. If your summary only works when read carefully, it won’t travel well.  
When you listen to your opening lines out loud, you can hear whether it’s crisp or foggy, grounded or hypey.  
  
## The structure that prevents both vagueness and hype  
You only need four parts:  
## 1) Claim  
What you believe is true right now.  
## 2) Basis  
What that belief is based on (the anchor).  
## 3) Risk  
What could make the claim wrong or change the plan.  
## 4) Ask  
What decision, approval, or next step you need.  
That’s the whole summary. It’s not long. It’s not fancy. It’s just complete.  
Here’s what it looks like in plain language:  
* **Claim:** “We can ship the May release on time, but only with reduced scope.”  
* **Basis:** “QA findings show Feature B is unstable; A is ready.”  
* **Risk:** “If we keep B, we likely slip 1–2 weeks.”  
* **Ask:** “Approve shipping A only on May 15.”  
Executives love this because it’s decision-shaped. There’s nothing to guess.  
  
## What makes a summary “forward-proof”  
Forward-proof summaries have three qualities:  
## They name the decision  
Not the topic. The decision.  
Bad: “Update on onboarding project.”
Better: “Decision needed: pilot onboarding flow vs full rollout next week.”  
## They include at least one hard anchor  
A number, a date, a concrete outcome, a clear constraint.  
Bad: “Engagement is strong.”
Better: “Week-one activation is 62% vs 45% baseline.”  
## They state uncertainty like an adult  
Not with hand-waving, but with a real risk statement.  
Bad: “We’re monitoring.”
Better: “Risk: support coverage is thin next week; if incidents spike, we pause rollout.”  
This is not negativity. This is credibility.  
  
## A realistic before/after (where most summaries go wrong)  
## Before (sounds nice, travels badly)  
“We’ve made good progress on the rollout and feedback has been positive. The team is aligned and we’re tracking toward our target timeline. Next steps are to continue monitoring and address any issues as they arise.”  
If that gets forwarded, the reader can’t do anything with it. Also, it subtly promises everything will be fine—without evidence.  
## After (same situation, now it’s usable)  
**Claim:** “Rollout is on track for May 15, with one open risk.”
**Basis:** “Core flow is stable in staging; week-one test group completed onboarding at 62% vs 45% baseline.”
**Risk:** “Support coverage is thin next week; if error rate rises above X for Y minutes, we pause.”
**Ask:** “Approve expanding from 10% to 25% traffic on Monday.”  
That version survives forwarding because it’s specific, measurable, and decision-ready.  
  
## The “calibrated certainty” trick  
One reason summaries get hypey is that people confuse confidence with competence.  
You don’t need big language. You need accurate language.  
Here are honest, professional ways to calibrate claims:  
* “We have early signal that…”  
* “Based on the first two weeks of data…”  
* “This is likely, assuming X holds.”  
* “We don’t have enough evidence to conclude Y yet.”  
* “The plan is viable if we accept tradeoff Z.”  
These phrases are not hedges. They’re precision. They make you harder to quote incorrectly.  
  
## Try this on read‑aloud.com (a 45‑second check)  
Paste the first 6–8 sentences of your executive summary into read‑aloud.com and listen once.  
As you listen, ask:  
* If someone heard only this, would they know what changed?  
* Would they know what you want them to do?  
* Are there any sentences that sound like marketing?  
The “marketing” test is simple: if a sentence could be used on a website without changing a word, it probably doesn’t belong in an exec summary.  
Replace it with an anchor: a number, a date, a constraint, or a clear tradeoff.  
  
## The executive summary template you can reuse  
Use this block at the top of memos, project updates, and proposals:  
## Decision/Ask: (one sentence)
Recommendation: (one sentence)
Basis: (2–3 bullets; include at least one hard anchor)  
*   
## Risks: (1–2 bullets; include trigger + impact)  
*   
**If approved, next step:** (one sentence + date)  
This template avoids the most common failure: writing a summary that feels “informative” but doesn’t lead to action.  
  
## The final filter: the “quote test”  
Before you send, pick the most confident sentence in your summary and ask:  
**Would I be comfortable seeing this quoted back to me in a month?**  
If not, rewrite it. Usually you don’t need to weaken it; you need to make it more precise:  
* add the timeframe  
* add the basis  
* add the condition  
* state the tradeoff  
That’s how you avoid the painful meeting where someone says, “But your summary said…”  
  
## Executive summaries aren’t about sounding impressive  
They’re about reducing confusion and speeding decisions.  
If you write in Claim/Basis/Risk/Ask shape—and you do one quick listen to make sure it doesn’t drift into fog or hype—you’ll produce summaries that travel cleanly, survive forwarding, and make you look like someone who deals in reality.
