Use Read‑Aloud like this:
1. Copy your email or message draft.
2. Paste into Read‑Aloud.
3. Press Start at **1.0×**.
4. Don’t look at the text for the first listen if you can avoid it.
5. Ask one question:
**If a colleague sent me this, how would it land?**
If the answer is “a little sharp” or “kind of confusing” or “I’d feel put on the spot,” you’ve just saved yourself a thread.
## Fix the structure first. Tone improves automatically.
A surprising amount of “tone” is actually **structure**.
When your ask is unclear, the message feels pressuring.
When your context is missing, the message feels abrupt.
When your email is long, it feels like a lecture.
Before you tweak niceties, make sure the skeleton is solid:
**Context → Ask → Next step**
A clean opener often looks like this:
* **Context:** “Quick update on the Q1 timeline.”
* **Ask:** “Can you confirm whether we’re still shipping Friday?”
* **Next step:** “If not, send the new date and I’ll update the plan.”
That’s not “corporate.” It’s respectful. It doesn’t make the reader hunt for what you want.
## The phrases that create accidental tension
Listening makes these show up immediately. Some are obvious; others sneak in because they’re common.
**1) Minimizers that make you sound unsure**
* “Just…”
* “Kind of…”
* “I was wondering if…”
Replace with clear language that still feels polite:
* “Can you…”
* “Please…”
* “I’d like to…”
**2) Blame-shaped sentences**
* “You didn’t…”
* “As per my last email…”
* “I already told you…”
Even when you’re right, these usually create defensiveness. If you need urgency, put it in the constraint, not the blame:
* “We’re blocked until we have X.”
* “To hit the deadline, I need X by 3pm.”
**3) Rhetorical questions**
* “Why would we do it that way?”
* “Did you even read…?”
These land like an eye-roll in text form. If you’re frustrated, translate the frustration into a neutral observation:
* “I’m seeing a mismatch between A and B. Can we confirm which one is correct?”
**4) The “FYI” weapon**
“FYI” can be fine. It can also read like: *you should have known this*. If you’re sending something that matters, be explicit:
* “Sharing this so you’re not surprised later.”
* “Flagging this early in case it changes your plan.”
## A practical “temperature dial” you can use
Sometimes you need to be warmer. Sometimes you need to be firmer. Listening helps you choose.
**To make a message warmer (without adding fluff):**
* Add one sentence that signals good intent:
    * “I know you’re juggling a lot—thank you.”
    * “Appreciate your help getting this across the line.”
* Give a reason for the ask:
    * “So we don’t miss the client deadline…”
* Offer a small option:
    * “If Friday won’t work, what’s the earliest realistic date?”
**To make a message firmer (without sounding harsh):**
* Remove hedges.
* Move the ask up.
* Use a deadline.
* Use bullets for clarity.
Firm doesn’t require sharpness. It requires specificity.
## Before/after: a follow-up that doesn’t start a fight
**Before:**
“Just checking in again—any update? We really need this.”
Sounds irritated. Also vague.
**After:**
“Checking in on the revised contract.
Can you send the latest version by **2pm today**? If that timing won’t work, tell me what time you can commit to so I can update the client.”
Clear, respectful, and hard to misread.
## The “eyes closed” test for leadership emails
If you’re writing to someone more senior, tone gets even trickier. What feels “brief” to you can feel abrupt to them—or vice versa.
A solid trick:
* Listen once with your eyes closed.
* If the first sentence doesn’t explain why you’re emailing, you’re relying on the recipient to infer context. Don’t make them.
A leadership-friendly structure:
* “I’m asking for a decision on X.”
* “Option A is fastest, Option B is safer.”
* “If you agree, I’ll proceed today.”
## The final checklist (run it after the listen)
Before you send, check these:
* ☐ The first line says why I’m writing.
* ☐ The ask is one clear sentence.
* ☐ The next step / deadline is explicit.
* ☐ I removed the words that make me sound irritated or unsure.
* ☐ I didn’t accidentally assign blame.
* ☐ I included the minimum context needed to act.
* ☐ If this is sensitive, I chose directness over “hinting.”
## Why this is worth doing
At a certain point in your career, the cost of a messy thread is not “a few extra minutes.” It’s attention, trust, and momentum. It’s your reputation as someone who communicates cleanly under pressure.
The nice part is how low-effort the fix is: **copy, paste, press Start**. You’re not polishing for perfection. You’re preventing misunderstandings before they get expensive.
