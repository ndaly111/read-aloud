  <h1>How to Listen to PDFs With Read‑Aloud</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>
    PDFs come in every flavor: clean text, messy formatting, or image-only scans. Read‑Aloud works best when you can extract selectable text, paste manageable sections, and set a pace that matches your goal. This guide covers quick extraction methods, troubleshooting messy formatting, and routines that keep long papers listenable without losing context.
  </p>

  <div class="callout"><strong>Important:</strong> If a PDF is scanned and has no selectable text, you’ll need optical character recognition (OCR) before using Read‑Aloud. After OCR, proof a small sample to catch errors before listening to the full document.</div>

  <h2>Extract text cleanly</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the PDF in your preferred viewer and try selecting a few sentences. If they copy correctly into a plain text editor, you’re good to go.</li>
    <li>For messy copies with line breaks, paste into a simple editor (or the input box) and remove extra spacing. Short paragraphs work better than a wall of text.</li>
    <li>If the PDF is images only, run OCR in a trusted tool, then copy small segments to verify that characters are accurate.</li>
    <li>Keep figures and tables separate; listening to dense tables works better at a slower speed with clear headers read aloud first.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Organize for long PDFs</h2>
  <p>
    Academic articles and manuals often exceed 20 pages. Break them into logical sections: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and appendices. Save each section in a note so you can re‑paste quickly if playback stops. Pair this with the <a href="/guide-reading-long-documents.html">long documents guide</a> for pacing ideas.
  </p>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Skipping a test paragraph:</strong> Always paste a small sample to confirm characters aren’t garbled, especially after OCR.</li>
    <li><strong>Copying tables as-is:</strong> Tables rarely read cleanly. Summarize headers and totals yourself, then listen to that summary.</li>
    <li><strong>Using one voice for all content:</strong> Technical math-heavy sections may benefit from a slower, clearer voice than the narrative intro.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring mobile power saving:</strong> Phones may pause playback when the screen locks. For multi-hour PDFs, use desktop or keep the screen awake.</li>
    <li><strong>Pasting too much at once:</strong> Huge chunks make it harder to reorient if audio stops mid-page. Stick to 2–3 paragraphs at a time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Copy the abstract and paste it into Read‑Aloud. Set speed to 1.0x for a clear overview.</li>
    <li>Move to the methods section, slow to 0.9x, and listen while highlighting any step you need to revisit.</li>
    <li>For results, paste one subsection at a time. Pause after each figure description and write a one-sentence takeaway.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="/guide-keyboard-shortcuts.html">keyboard shortcuts</a> to pause quickly when you hit equations or footnotes.</li>
    <li>Finish with the discussion at 1.1x to refresh the big picture and decide whether you need a second pass.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Formatting fixes that save time</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strip headers/footers:</strong> Remove repeating page numbers or running titles before listening so you are not distracted every page turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Normalize spacing:</strong> Replace double line breaks with single ones, and convert bullet characters to hyphens for smoother speech output.</li>
    <li><strong>Handle equations manually:</strong> When equations are critical, read them visually, summarize in plain language, and paste that summary for audio playback.</li>
    <li><strong>Use section dividers:</strong> Insert short dividers like “— Methods —” between pasted chunks so you immediately hear where a section begins.</li>
    <li><strong>Spot-check references:</strong> If references dominate a section, summarize the three most relevant citations and skip the rest in audio.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Does Read‑Aloud keep my PDF?</strong> No. You paste text manually. Browser voices keep text on your device; premium voices process text on our server but don't store it.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I handle citations?</strong> Consider skipping dense citation lists unless you need them. Mark key references manually instead.</li>
    <li><strong>What if OCR is imperfect?</strong> Proof one paragraph aloud to catch repeated errors. Adjust or redo the OCR before continuing.</li>
    <li><strong>Is there a mobile-friendly workflow?</strong> Yes, but keep chunks small and check the <a href="/guide-offline-use.html">offline guide</a> for tips on maintaining playback.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I keep listening while taking notes?</strong> Yes. Open a second window or split-screen view with your notes app so you can type while audio plays.</li>
    <li><strong>What if I lose my place?</strong> Keep a short index of section titles with timestamps (“03:15 Methods – sampling”) and restart from the last marker instead of rescrolling the PDF.</li>
    <li><strong>Where do I get more help?</strong> Visit the <a href="/help.html">Help</a> page for troubleshooting and browse other workflows on the <a href="/guides.html">guides page</a>.</li>
