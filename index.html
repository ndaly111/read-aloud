      Paste the text you own, choose a system voice you like, and let Read‑Aloud read back articles,
      homework, reports, or drafts. The tool runs fully in your browser using built-in voices,
      so nothing you paste leaves your device.

    <h2>What Read‑Aloud is and why it exists</h2>
    <div class="grid two-col">
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Read‑Aloud started as a simple browser experiment: could a distraction-free web page make
          the native speech synthesis API friendlier for everyday reading? Over time it grew into a
          focused tool with progress meters, keyboard shortcuts, and clear privacy defaults so you
          can keep your attention on the text instead of fiddling with menus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students use it to turn lecture notes into listenable study sessions. Writers and editors
          rely on it to catch phrasing issues their eyes skipped over. Readers with low vision use it
          to rest their eyes during long documents. Language learners pair slower playback with their
          own reading to practice pronunciation and rhythm.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The tool is deliberately lightweight. There is no account system, no cloud conversion, and
          no upload to third parties. It leans on voices that already live inside your operating
          system or browser. That design keeps latency low and makes the experience safe for school
          laptops, locked-down tablets, and privacy-conscious professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything you need stays on one page. If you want a quick walkthrough, the
          <a href="guide-how-to-use.html">How to Use Read‑Aloud</a> guide and the
          <a href="guides.html">Guides library</a> break down the controls with screenshots and
          practical routines.

    <h2>How the tool works (and what it does not do)</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Read‑Aloud slices your text into manageable chunks, queues them for the Speech Synthesis
        API, and updates the progress bar as each chunk finishes. Voice selection happens locally:
        the tool asks your browser for available voices, filters them by language, and presents the
        list in the dropdown. If you change the rate slider, the next chunk uses the new speed so you
        can adjust pacing on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the tool uses system voices, playback quality depends on your operating system. On
        macOS and iOS you will see premium-quality voices like “Siri Voice 4.” On Windows and some
        Android builds you may see a smaller list. The <a href="voices.html">Voice Gallery</a>
        explains why voice lists differ and how to add more options.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser sandbox means a few limits: MP3 export is not available because the Speech
        Synthesis API does not provide audio blobs; background playback may pause when a laptop goes
        to sleep; and some mobile browsers require a tap before they allow audio output. These limits
        are described in more depth on the <a href="download-mp3.html">MP3 export note</a> and in
        the <a href="help.html">Help Center</a> troubleshooting checklists.

    <h2>Who the tool is for</h2>
    <div class="grid three-col">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Students</h3>
        <p>
          Turn reading assignments into short listening sprints. Copy the section you need, set a
          comfortable voice, and let the progress meter keep you honest about pacing. Pair the tool
          with a timer and active-recall prompts from the
          <a href="guides/tts-study-loop-templates.html">Study Loop Templates guide</a>.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Writers &amp; editors</h3>
        <p>
          Listening exposes clunky phrasing that looks fine on screen. Keep the speed at 1.0× and tap
          <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> to pause when you hear a sentence worth
          rewriting. The <a href="guides/tts-for-writers.html">Proofreading guide for writers</a>
          outlines a repeatable workflow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Accessibility &amp; focus</h3>
        <p>
          Readers managing eye strain, ADHD, or dyslexia often blend listening with on-screen
          tracking. Use the slow-speed range (0.8–1.0×) and shorter chunks to keep place. The
          <a href="guides/tts-for-adhd-focus.html">Focus guide</a> and
          <a href="guides/tts-for-dyslexia-support.html">Dyslexia guide</a> include pacing ideas.

    <h2>Privacy posture and data handling</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Everything you paste stays in your browser tab. Read‑Aloud does not send text to a server,
        store documents, or log what you type. Analytics capture only high-level usage to understand
        which pages are visited, not what content you listen to. Ads are limited to informational
        pages like this one; the <a href="app.html">Tool page</a> intentionally avoids ad loading so
        user-pasted text is never next to ad code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For extra caution, avoid pasting confidential contracts, protected student records, or
        regulated medical details. When in doubt, use short excerpts or scrub sensitive fields. The
        <a href="guides/tts-privacy-safety.html">Privacy &amp; Safety guide</a> lists safe habits
        and explains why Read‑Aloud leans on local voices instead of cloud synthesis.

    <h2>Troubleshooting at a glance</h2>
    <div class="grid two-col">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Common quick fixes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you see an empty voice list, reload after unlocking your device audio or try another browser.</li>
          <li>No sound on iPhone or iPad? Toggle the physical mute switch and confirm the tab has audio permission.</li>
          <li>Text not finishing? Reduce the chunk size by shortening the pasted section and retry.</li>
          <li>Hearing robotic output? Switch to a different system voice or lower the speed to 0.9×.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Where to get full answers</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="help.html">Help Center</a> documents platform-specific fixes, including
          offline behavior, missing voices, and performance tips. You can also jump straight to the
          <a href="voices.html">Voice Gallery</a> for OS-specific install steps or send a detailed
          report through the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> using the bug report template.

    <h2>How to make the most of Read‑Aloud</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Keep your sessions short and intentional. Break long papers into sections, use the Pause and
        Resume buttons when you need to mark edits, and note tricky terms you want to double-check.
        Consider pairing a comfortable pair of wired headphones with the Recommendations at the
        bottom of this site for clearer audio and fewer distractions.
