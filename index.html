  <h2>How to use this tool</h2>
  <p>Copy any text, paste it into the box above, pick a voice and speed, then press <strong>Start</strong>. Premium neural voices sound natural and human-like. Browser voices work offline and never send your text anywhere. You can pause or resume at any time, and the progress bar shows your progress.</p>
  <p>For longer reading, break the material into sections. Paste one section, listen, take notes, and move to the next. This keeps the app responsive and helps you remember more of what you hear. If you are on iPhone or iPad and hear nothing, flip the Ring/Silent switch, refresh the page, and tap <strong>Start</strong> again. More fixes live in the <a href="/help.html">Help guide</a>.</p>

  <h3>Who this is for</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Students and researchers</strong> who want to review articles and lecture notes while resting their eyes or walking between classes.</li>
    <li><strong>People with dyslexia or ADHD</strong> who find listening easier than visually scanning long paragraphs. The app stays simple so you can focus on the words.</li>
    <li><strong>Language learners</strong> who want to hear pronunciation and pacing from the voices built into their browser and operating system.</li>
    <li><strong>Editors and proofreaders</strong> who catch awkward phrasing by ear. Listening at 0.9× often surfaces missing words or repeated phrases.</li>
    <li><strong>Anyone who prefers hands‑free reading</strong> while cooking, commuting, or stretching.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Features that help you listen better</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Premium neural voices:</strong> natural-sounding voices powered by Microsoft Edge TTS. Text is processed in real-time and not stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Browser voices:</strong> work offline and keep your text completely private on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed control:</strong> slide between 0.5× and 2×. Slow down for dense material, speed up for quick skims.</li>
    <li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts:</strong> press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on Mac) to start, <kbd>Space</kbd> to pause/resume, and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to stop.</li>
    <li><strong>Progress indicator:</strong> track elapsed and remaining time so you can plan breaks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips for best results</h3>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chunk long documents:</strong> copy one heading or section at a time for smoother playback.</li>
      <li><strong>Pick a calm environment:</strong> pair a comfortable headset and reduce background noise for easier focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment with voices:</strong> if one sounds robotic, switch to another language/region option in your browser.</li>
      <li><strong>Use repetition:</strong> replay tricky sections at 0.8×, then do a fast 1.3× skim to reinforce.</li>
      <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> ensure the device is not muted by the hardware switch; see <a href="/help.html">Help</a> for the quick checklist.</li>
      <li><strong>Pair with timers:</strong> try 25‑minute listening blocks followed by a 5‑minute stretch to stay fresh.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Why Use Read-Aloud?</h3>
  <p>
    Text-to-speech isn't just for accessibility—it's a powerful tool for anyone who writes, learns, or communicates for work.
    When you <strong>listen to your own writing</strong>, you catch errors your eyes miss: awkward phrasing, missing words,
    unclear logic, and tone problems that only reveal themselves when spoken aloud. It's like having an editor on demand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read-Aloud works entirely in your browser, so you can paste sensitive text without worrying about uploads or accounts.
    Choose from natural-sounding voices, adjust speed to match your focus, and get instant feedback on everything from
    email drafts to research papers. No installation, no signup—just paste and press Start.
  </p>

  <h4>Common Use Cases</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proofread your writing:</strong> Writers, students, and professionals use TTS to catch typos, repeated words,
    and sentences that "look fine" but don't flow when spoken. If you've ever sent an email with a glaring typo you swear
    you checked, listening would have caught it.</li>

    <li><strong>Study more effectively:</strong> Turn lecture notes, textbooks, or articles into audio you can review while
    commuting, exercising, or doing chores. Listening forces you to process information sequentially—no skimming,
    no false sense of understanding. Students report better retention when they combine reading and listening.</li>

    <li><strong>Practice a new language:</strong> Language learners use Read-Aloud to master pronunciation, rhythm, and pacing.
    Paste a paragraph in your target language, listen at normal speed to hear natural flow, then slow it down to practice
    shadowing. It's like having a patient native speaker who never gets tired of repeating.</li>

    <li><strong>Check your tone before sending:</strong> Email and Slack messages that sound "direct" in your head can read as
    cold or sharp to others. Hearing your message spoken by a neutral voice reveals how it actually lands. Busy professionals
    use this "tone test" to avoid awkward follow-up threads.</li>

    <li><strong>Accessibility and fatigue:</strong> For people with dyslexia, visual impairments, or screen fatigue, TTS makes
    long documents manageable. It's also useful when you're too tired to read but still need to process information—like
    reviewing a contract at the end of a long workday.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over 50,000 people use Read-Aloud every month for these exact scenarios. Whether you're preparing for a presentation,
    debugging a tricky paragraph, or just trying to get through a dense PDF, a quick listen often reveals what hours of
    staring at the screen won't. <a href="/blog/">Browse our guides</a> to see specific workflows for your use case.
