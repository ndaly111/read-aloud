  <h1>Local vs Cloud Text‑to‑Speech: A Decision Guide for Privacy, Voice Quality, and Trust</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>
    If you’ve ever pasted something personal into a text‑to‑speech box—an email draft, a doctor’s note, a cover letter, a set of study notes—you’ve probably paused for a second and thought:
    <strong>“Where does this text go?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    That one question matters more than most people realize, because “text‑to‑speech” can mean two very different setups.
  </p>

  <h2>The two ways TTS usually works</h2>

  <h3>1) Local (on‑device / browser‑native)</h3>
  <p>
    Your phone or computer has voices built in. When you press Start, the speech is generated by your device’s speech engine and played through your speakers.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In plain terms:</strong> your text doesn’t need to leave your device just to be spoken.</p>

  <h3>2) Cloud TTS (server‑generated)</h3>
  <p>
    You paste text, the service sends it to a server, the server generates the audio, and the audio is streamed back to you.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In plain terms:</strong> your text leaves your device so a company can turn it into audio.</p>

  <p>
    Cloud can sound amazing. Local can feel simpler and safer. The right choice depends on what you’re reading—and how private it is.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Read‑Aloud is “local by design”</h2>

  <p>
    Read‑Aloud (read-aloud.com) is built around local speech. The site itself doesn’t upload the text you paste into the tool to our servers. Speech is generated by your browser/operating system’s speech engine (via the Web Speech API), and the audio plays in your browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s not a slogan; it’s a design decision.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of people use TTS for things that are personal or high‑stakes: school accommodations, work documents, applications, letters, private messages. For those use cases, the goal is usually “let me listen now” without creating new privacy headaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    A quick trust note: Read‑Aloud doesn’t require accounts, and we don’t store your pasted text in a database. Like most websites, our hosting provider may process standard server logs (requested page, timestamps, basic device/network info) for security and reliability—and if you email support, we receive what you send because that’s how support works.
  </p>

  <h2>When cloud TTS may still be worth it</h2>

  <p>There are real reasons people choose cloud TTS. Here are the most common ones:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>You want the most natural voice possible.</strong> Some cloud voices sound closer to an audiobook narrator than most built‑in system voices.</li>
    <li><strong>You need a downloadable audio file.</strong> If your goal is an MP3 you can save, send, or move to another device, cloud tools often support that directly.</li>
    <li><strong>You want consistency across devices.</strong> Local voice lists vary by browser and OS. Cloud voices are usually the same everywhere.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If that’s what you need, cloud might be the right call—especially for non‑sensitive text (public articles, public‑domain books, language practice paragraphs).
  </p>

  <p>
    But if the text is private, slow down and ask a few simple questions before you paste:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Do you store my text or generated audio?</strong> If yes, for how long?</li>
    <li><strong>Is my text used to train models or “improve the service”?</strong> If the policy is vague, assume the safest interpretation.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I delete what I uploaded?</strong> Is there a button, an account setting, or a support process?</li>
    <li><strong>Who else touches the data?</strong> Sub‑processors, contractors, analytics providers—anyone beyond “only the core service.”</li>
    <li><strong>Is it encrypted in transit?</strong> It should be HTTPS. If it isn’t, don’t use it.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A good provider answers these clearly. If you have to decode the policy like a contract, that’s a signal in itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Safety checklist (before you paste anything sensitive)</h2>

  <p>
    Even with a local tool, your privacy can be undone by your environment. Here’s the checklist I recommend (and use myself):
  </p>

  <p>
    ☐ I’m not screen‑sharing (or the shared window doesn’t include the text box).<br>
    ☐ I’m not on a shared/public computer.<br>
    ☐ I trust the browser extensions installed in this browser (some extensions can read page content).<br>
    ☐ The text does not include passwords, 2FA codes, or secret links.<br>
    ☐ If it’s sensitive, I paste only the section I need—not the entire document.
  </p>

  <p>Two practical extras that save headaches:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use a “clean” browser profile for TTS (minimal extensions, fewer surprises).</li>
    <li>If you’re trying to figure out whether a voice is truly on‑device, test with airplane mode. If it still speaks, that’s a strong hint the voice isn’t relying on a server connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Read‑Aloud doesn’t offer downloadable audio</h2>

  <p>
    This is one of the most common questions we see: <strong>“Can you add an MP3 download button?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The short version is: <strong>most system voices don’t give websites an audio file.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Read‑Aloud uses the Web Speech API’s speech synthesis. That API is built for playback: you provide text, the browser speaks it through the device speakers, and you can pause/resume/stop. What it does <em>not</em> do is hand the website a clean audio recording (like a WAV/MP3) that can be saved.
  </p>

  <p>
    To reliably create downloadable audio, a site usually needs server‑side TTS (cloud) or a native app with deeper access to audio pipelines. Both of those move you away from “local by design.” So Read‑Aloud makes a deliberate trade: private, in‑browser listening instead of file export.
  </p>

  <h2>The quick decision rule</h2>

  <p>If you want the one‑minute takeaway:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Choose local TTS</strong> when privacy matters, the text is sensitive, and you want something lightweight that speaks right now.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose cloud TTS</strong> when you need an MP3, want the most natural voice possible, or you’re working with text you don’t mind sending off‑device.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And if you’re not sure: use both. Cloud for public content, local for private content. It’s a small habit that prevents big regrets.
