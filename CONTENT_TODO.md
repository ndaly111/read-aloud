# Content Expansion TODO

## High priority
- [ ] help.html — Expand into a fuller help article with FAQs, troubleshooting steps, and common workflows.
- [ ] guides.html — Introduce who the guides are for and how to use them effectively.
- [ ] contact.html — Add trust-building copy on the purpose of the contact form, response expectations, and support scope.

## Optional / consider expanding
- [ ] index.html — Assess if it needs more “what it is / who it helps / how it works” overview copy.
- [ ] guide-privacy.html — Consider lengthening to match other guides.
- [ ] guide-how-to-use.html — Consider expanding for consistency with other long-form guides.
