  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

  <p>
    Your brain is excellent at “autocorrecting” what you meant to write — which is why you can read your own draft
    and miss obvious mistakes. Text‑to‑speech helps because it turns your writing into something you can
    <strong>listen</strong> to like a reader would.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Best for:</strong> essays, emails, cover letters, reports, blog posts, resumes, and anything where clarity matters.
  </div>

  <h2>Read‑Aloud specifics</h2>
  <div class="specific">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use a neutral voice.</strong> “Character” voices (or overly robotic ones) can hide real writing issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Voices are device-dependent.</strong> If a voice sounds wrong, try another voice (or another browser).</li>
      <li><strong>Pro editing tip:</strong> slow down slightly (0.85×–0.95×). Your ears catch missing words better when speech is a bit slower.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">If your voice list is empty or iOS audio is silent, see <a href="help.html">Help</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Quick Proofreading Workflow (10 Minutes)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Paste your draft into <a href="index.html">Read‑Aloud</a>.</li>
    <li>Set speed to <strong>0.9×</strong> (slightly slow helps catch issues).</li>
    <li>Press <strong>Start</strong> and follow along lightly.</li>
    <li>When you hear a problem, <strong>Pause</strong>, fix it in your original document, then resume.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>10-minute proofreading checklist (copy/paste)</h2>
  <div class="template">
<pre>☐ 0:00–1:00  Setup
   - Open the original document (where you will edit)
   - Open Read‑Aloud and paste the same text
   - Set speed to 0.9×

☐ 1:00–4:00  Pass 1: “missing & repeated”
   - Missing words (your brain skips them visually)
   - Repeated words ("the the")
   - Wrong small words (a/an, to/too, of/off)

☐ 4:00–7:00  Pass 2: “sentence shape”
   - Run‑ons (too long)
   - Punctuation that doesn’t match the meaning
   - Awkward transitions ("However", "Therefore", etc.)

☐ 7:00–9:00  High‑risk items
   - Names, dates, numbers, measurements, URLs
   - Headings and bullet lists (are they parallel?)

☐ 9:00–10:00 Final
   - Re‑listen to the first paragraph and the last paragraph once more</pre>
  </div>

  <h2>What TTS Helps You Catch</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Missing words:</strong> “I went to store” (your eyes may skip it; your ears won’t).</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicated words:</strong> “the the”</li>
    <li><strong>Run-on sentences:</strong> you can hear when a sentence never ends.</li>
    <li><strong>Awkward phrasing:</strong> clunky transitions become obvious when spoken.</li>
    <li><strong>Punctuation problems:</strong> TTS often “stumbles” where punctuation is confusing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Two Passes Beat One Pass</h2>
  <p>
    If you have time, do two short passes instead of one long one:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pass 1 (clarity):</strong> Does every paragraph have a clear point?</li>
    <li><strong>Pass 2 (polish):</strong> Grammar, word choice, repetition, and tone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Choose the Right Voice</h2>
  <p>
    A neutral voice is usually best for editing. If the voice is overly dramatic or robotic, it can distract you.
    Try a couple in the <a href="voices.html">Voice Gallery</a> and pick the one that feels “invisible.”
  </p>

  <h2>Editing Prompts (Ask These While Listening)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the main point of this paragraph?</li>
    <li>Is any sentence doing too many jobs?</li>
    <li>Are there repeated words in close proximity?</li>
    <li>Would a reader understand this without context?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Fixes That Improve Writing Fast</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Split long sentences into two.</li>
    <li>Replace vague words (“things,” “stuff,” “very”) with specific ones.</li>
    <li>Move the main point to the first sentence of the paragraph.</li>
    <li>Cut repeated phrases.</li>
  </ul>
