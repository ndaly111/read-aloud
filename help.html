    <h2>iPhone and iPad: fixing no-sound playback</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        iOS and iPadOS protect speakers until you explicitly allow a page to play sound. If Read‑Aloud
        looks like it is playing but you do not hear audio, work through this checklist in order.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Flip the physical mute switch to the unmuted position. Some models still route Safari audio through the ringer mute toggle.</li>
        <li>Press the hardware volume up button twice while Safari is open to raise the media volume, not the ringer volume.</li>
        <li>Tap inside the page once and press the <strong>Start</strong> button again. Mobile Safari requires a user gesture before allowing speech synthesis.</li>
        <li>If you are using Guided Access or Focus modes, briefly exit them and retry; some profiles block web audio.</li>
        <li>Try another browser such as Chrome for iOS. It still uses Safari’s engine but sometimes refreshes the voice list when Safari stalls.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If the issue persists, reboot the device to clear the speech queue, then open <a href="app.html">read-aloud.com/app</a> as the first tab and retest.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="empty-voices">
    <h2>Empty or missing voice list</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Read‑Aloud depends on voices provided by your operating system. When the dropdown appears
        empty, it usually means the browser could not load the list yet. Try these steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reload the page after waiting five seconds. Some browsers populate the list only after the <code>voiceschanged</code> event fires.</li>
        <li>Switch browsers. Chrome, Edge, and Safari expose more voices than some privacy or kiosk browsers.</li>
        <li>Install additional system voices. On macOS, open <em>System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content</em>; on Windows, open <em>Settings → Time &amp; Language → Speech</em>; on Android, open <em>Settings → Text-to-speech output</em>.</li>
        <li>If you are on a managed school device, confirm that speech synthesis is allowed. Some admin profiles disable it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="voices.html">Voice Gallery</a> explains how each platform exposes voices and how to add more. After installing a new voice, close and reopen the browser to refresh the list.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="offline">
    <h2>Using Read‑Aloud offline</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Read‑Aloud can keep speaking while offline as long as the page is already loaded and the
        selected voice is stored locally. System voices on macOS, iOS, Windows, and ChromeOS usually
        work without connectivity after the first use. Cloud-only voices offered by some extensions or
        third-party engines will not show up here because the tool intentionally avoids external
        streaming for privacy reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before boarding a flight or heading into a low-signal area, open <a href="app.html">the tool</a>,
        choose a voice, and press Start for a few seconds. That initial playback caches the voice. If
        you later see errors offline, shorten the pasted text and make sure your device is not killing
        the browser tab in battery-saver mode.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="long-text">
    <h2>Performance tips for long text</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Very long pastes can overwhelm the browser queue. Break documents into smaller sections—three
        to five minutes of listening time is a sweet spot—and press Resume between sections to keep
        your place. Lowering the speed to 0.9× can also improve stability on older devices.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use headings as cut points. Copy one chapter or subheading at a time.</li>
        <li>Close other tabs running audio or heavy scripts to free memory.</li>
        <li>If timing is important, note the progress percentage when you pause so you can resume from a nearby paragraph.</li>
        <li>For research, keep a notepad next to the player and jot timestamps when you hear something to revisit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="guides/tts-for-adhd-focus.html">Focus guide</a> and
        <a href="guides/tts-voice-selection.html">Voice Selection guide</a> include pacing templates
        that balance comprehension with speed.
      </p>

  </section>

  <section id="limitations">
    <h2>Known limitations</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Read‑Aloud runs entirely in your browser, so a few constraints are built-in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No MP3 export:</strong> The Speech Synthesis API does not return audio files. If you need recordings, consider native screen recording with system audio while respecting copyright.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep and lock screens:</strong> Laptops that go to sleep will pause playback. On mobile, keep the screen awake during long listens.</li>
        <li><strong>Tab focus:</strong> Some browsers throttle background tabs. Keep Read‑Aloud in the foreground for the most reliable timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice quality varies:</strong> The app lists what your device provides; premium voices require installing them at the OS level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We track browser changes and update the <a href="about.html">About page</a> with roadmap items when APIs evolve.

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Can I use Read‑Aloud for school?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The tool is designed to be classroom-friendly and does not require sign-ins. Still, avoid pasting private student data.</p>
      <h3>Does it work with PDFs?</h3>
      <p>Copy the text from the PDF and paste it into the tool. Scanned PDFs without selectable text need OCR before they can be spoken.</p>
      <h3>Is my text stored?</h3>
      <p>No. Everything runs locally in your browser. Analytics track page visits only, not the text itself.</p>
      <h3>Where can I get live help?</h3>
      <p>Send a message through the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>. Include your browser, device, and a short description of what happened so we can reproduce the issue.</p>
