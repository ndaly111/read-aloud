  <h1>TTS for Focus: Chunking + Timers + Speed Settings for ADHD Brains</h1>
  <p class="guide-meta">Built for readers who need structure and short wins. Keep everything in the browser so task switching stays low.</p>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Why TTS helps with ADHD</h2>
    <p>
      Audio provides an external pace-maker. When the voice keeps moving, your brain has to follow,
      reducing the urge to re-read the same line. Pairing Read‑Aloud with a timer gives you a concrete
      finish line instead of an endless assignment. This guide layers small tactics to keep you engaged
      without adding complicated apps.
    </p>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Set up your environment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a voice that is calm and low-drama. Brighter voices can become irritating during long sessions.</li>
      <li>Use wired headphones or a single earbud so you can hear your surroundings but still follow the text.</li>
      <li>Close messaging tabs. If you must keep them open, use full-screen mode on the <a href="/app.html">tool</a> so alerts are hidden.</li>
      <li>Place a sticky note on your desk with your goal for the block (“Finish Section 3 notes”). Visual anchors help you return after a distraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>The 20–20–5 pattern</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>20 minutes listening + light notes.</strong> Paste 500–700 words. Keep speed at 1.0×. Write only quick markers (“define term,” “look up chart”).</li>
      <li><strong>20 minutes review.</strong> Pause the player, answer two recall questions, and rewrite any unclear sections in your own words.</li>
      <li><strong>5 minute reset.</strong> Stand up, stretch, or drink water. Avoid opening social apps. Restart with a new paste when the timer ends.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Use the <strong>Pause</strong> button instead of Stop so you can resume where you left off if you
      get interrupted. If you lose the thread, rewind one paragraph and lower speed to 0.9× for a softer re-entry.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Chunking that reduces overwhelm</h2>
    <p>
      Long articles trigger avoidance. Break them into named chunks before listening:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name each chunk (“Background,” “Method,” “Examples”) and write the names in your notebook.</li>
      <li>Paste only one chunk at a time. Knowing there is an end after a few minutes reduces anxiety.</li>
      <li>After each chunk, rate your focus from 1–5. If it drops below 3, shorten the next chunk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your browser throttles audio after switching tabs, keep Read‑Aloud in the foreground and move
      your notes to a small side window. The keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> returns the cursor to the textarea quickly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Speed settings that match your task</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0.85–0.95×:</strong> Use for dense reading, new topics, or when you are recovering from a distraction.</li>
      <li><strong>1.0–1.1×:</strong> Default for steady comprehension. Great for narrative articles and essays.</li>
      <li><strong>1.2×:</strong> Use only after a first listen to cement concepts while you follow along visually.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Avoid jumping speeds mid-paragraph. Adjust between chunks so your ears can adapt. If the voice
      sounds robotic at higher speeds, switch to a different system voice that handles faster rates more gracefully.
    </p>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Fail-safes when focus slips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When you notice zoning out, pause immediately and write one sentence about the last thing you heard. Resume from that sentence.</li>
      <li>If you restart the same paragraph more than twice, switch voices. The novelty often resets attention.</li>
      <li>Keep a “distraction parking lot” in your notes. When a thought pops up, jot it there instead of opening a new tab.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>related guides</strong> below to swap routines when today’s setup stops working.</li>
    </ul>
