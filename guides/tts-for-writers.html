  <h1>Text-to-Speech for Writers: A Proofreading Process That Finds the Mistakes Your Eyes Miss</h1>
  <p class="guide-meta">Great for essays, newsletters, reports, and UX copy. Uses Read‑Aloud with local voices so your drafts stay private.</p>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Why listen while editing?</h2>
    <p>
      Reading aloud forces rhythm and reveals missing words, doubled phrases, and awkward cadence. The
      progress meter keeps you honest; if your mind drifts at 40%, rewind a paragraph and fix the
      distraction. Listening also separates your brain from the visual layout, making tone and pacing
      issues stand out.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Prep your draft for audio</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy the section you want to edit (500–1,000 words) into the <a href="/app.html">tool</a>. If you write in Markdown, leave the headings—they help you navigate.</li>
      <li>Choose a neutral voice that contrasts with your own. Writers often prefer a different gender or accent so mistakes sound foreign and obvious.</li>
      <li>Set speed to 0.95× for first passes. Increase to 1.1× for later polishing once big issues are fixed.</li>
      <li>Close other tabs that make sound. Clean audio reduces fatigue during long sessions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>The three-pass proofreading loop</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Structure pass:</strong> Listen without touching the keyboard. Mark only headline moves—“move paragraph,” “swap order,” “cut example.” Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to pause when you need to jot a note.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity pass:</strong> Paste a single paragraph at a time. After each listen, rewrite the sentence that made you wince. Adjust speed to 1.0× so emphasis stays natural.</li>
      <li><strong>Polish pass:</strong> Increase speed to 1.2×. Fast playback surfaces extra words and filler (“just,” “very,” “actually”). Trim them immediately, then replay at normal speed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Keep sessions short—20 minutes of audio followed by a five-minute break. The tool’s progress bar
      helps you stop at a natural break instead of mid-sentence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Markup habits that save time</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of editing inside the player, keep your main draft open in another window and use a quick
      shorthand as you listen:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>[awk]</strong> for awkward pacing or emphasis.</li>
      <li><strong>[rep]</strong> for repeated words or phrases.</li>
      <li><strong>[cut]</strong> for sentences that add no meaning.</li>
      <li><strong>[ex]</strong> when you owe the reader an example or data point.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After the listen, jump back to your draft and resolve the tags in order. This keeps listening flow
      smooth and avoids constant context switching.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Voice selection for editing moods</h2>
    <p>
      Match the voice to the job:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Newsletters and marketing copy:</strong> Choose a bright, conversational voice at 1.05× to mimic a presenter.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical docs:</strong> Pick a calm, neutral voice. Slow to 0.9× when listening for exact terminology and API names.</li>
      <li><strong>Longform essays:</strong> Use two voices—one for drafting, another for the final pass. Switching voices refreshes your ears and exposes monotony.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are editing in a second language, filter by language in the dropdown so proper nouns are pronounced correctly. The <a href="/voices.html">Voice Gallery</a> lists platform-specific options.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>When something sounds “off”</h2>
    <p>
      If a sentence lands flat, ask these questions after pausing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Did two adjacent sentences start the same way? Combine or vary openings.</li>
      <li>Is the verb buried? Swap to a stronger verb and remove helper phrases like “in order to.”</li>
      <li>Does the example arrive too late? Move it closer to the claim so the audio cadence makes sense.</li>
      <li>Are you overusing parentheses or em dashes? Break into two sentences to simplify the spoken rhythm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Replay after each change. If the fix works, note it in a personal editing checklist so you can
      avoid repeating the same mistake next time.
    </p>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Publishing checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen once at normal speed without stopping to catch lingering typos.</li>
      <li>Scan headings and bullets visually to confirm they match the spoken sequence.</li>
      <li>Run a short listen (100–150 words) on mobile to ensure the layout is readable while you track along.</li>
      <li>Remove any placeholder tags you added during markup (<strong>[awk]</strong>, <strong>[ex]</strong>, etc.).</li>
      <li>Save your preferred voice and speed in a sticky note so the next session starts faster.</li>
    </ul>
