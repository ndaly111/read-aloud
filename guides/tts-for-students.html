  <h1>Text-to-Speech for Students: A Practical Workflow That Actually Improves Grades</h1>
  <p class="guide-meta">Applies to laptops, tablets, and school-managed devices. Uses the Read‑Aloud web tool with system voices.</p>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Why listen instead of only reading?</h2>
    <p>
      Hearing your own notes exposes gaps you cannot see when skimming. Read‑Aloud keeps everything in
      the browser so you can move between textbooks, PDFs, and LMS pages without extra apps. Audio
      doubles as an accountability timer: if you drift, the progress meter shows exactly where you
      stopped. This guide gives you a repeatable routine you can use all semester.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Set up once for the whole term</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open <a href="../app.html">read-aloud.com/app</a> and run a 10-second test clip. This grants the tab audio permission on your device.</li>
      <li>Select a voice you can tolerate for 20+ minutes. Natural voices on macOS/iOS or the newest Windows packs reduce fatigue; see the <a href="../voices.html">Voice Gallery</a> for install tips.</li>
      <li>Pick a default speed: start at 1.0×, then nudge to 1.1× for lighter reading or 0.9× for dense science text.</li>
      <li>Bookmark the page and pin the tab. On Chromebooks, right-click the tab and choose “Pin” so it loads quickly each study session.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Daily workflow (45–60 minute block)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Gather sources:</strong> Copy the section you need from your LMS or PDF. Aim for 500–800 words (about 3–5 minutes of audio).</li>
      <li><strong>Paste and preview:</strong> Drop it into the text box and scan for formatting issues. Remove duplicate headers or page numbers that distract while listening.</li>
      <li><strong>Start with a timer:</strong> Press <em>Start</em> and start a 15–20 minute timer. The goal is one uninterrupted listen. If you must pause, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> so you can resume without losing place.</li>
      <li><strong>Take “margin” notes:</strong> Keep a small notepad. When you hear a key fact, jot a two-word cue and the progress percent from the meter.</li>
      <li><strong>Active recall:</strong> After the clip ends, close the tab with your notes and explain the section out loud or in writing. Only then check the text again.</li>
      <li><strong>Repeat with the next section:</strong> Pace yourself through two or three sections, then take a five-minute break before starting a new block.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This rhythm keeps listens short enough to stay engaged and gives you time to encode the material
      before moving on. If you fall behind, shorten sections to 300–400 words until you rebuild focus.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Note-taking patterns that pair well with audio</h2>
    <p>Try one of these approaches to keep listening active:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Question-first:</strong> Before pressing Start, write three questions you expect the passage to answer. Pause only when you hear the answer and write it down.</li>
      <li><strong>Signal words:</strong> Listen for “because,” “for example,” and “however.” When you hear them, jot the clause that follows to build a cause/effect outline.</li>
      <li><strong>Vocabulary loop:</strong> For language classes, pause after each new term, repeat it aloud, then resume. Add phonetic hints in your notebook.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you prefer typing, open a split-screen with your notes app on the right and Read‑Aloud on the
      left. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> to jump the cursor back into the textarea when you need to paste the next section.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section" id="multilingual">
    <h2>Multilingual and ESL homework</h2>
    <p>
      Switch the <strong>Language</strong> dropdown to match the text you are pasting. This filters the
      voice list to voices that pronounce that language correctly. For bilingual assignments, keep two
      windows open with different language settings and use the Resume button to alternate between them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For pronunciation practice, slow speed to 0.8× and shadow a paragraph twice before moving on.</li>
      <li>For comprehension, listen once at 1.0× then again at 1.2× while following along visually. The faster repeat cements rhythm.</li>
      <li>Record tricky sentences in your notes with the voice name you used so you can replay them later.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Troubleshooting during exams or tight deadlines</h2>
    <p>
      School devices sometimes lock down audio. If voices disappear right before an exam, open the
      <a href="../help.html#empty-voices">missing voice checklist</a> and try another browser. If audio stutters, reduce speed to 0.9× and paste shorter segments. When Wi‑Fi is unstable, keep the tab open and avoid refreshing; the tool can continue speaking offline if the voice was already loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      If nothing helps, fall back to a backup plan: download a free system voice in Settings, reboot,
      and replay the section. Always keep a printed or offline copy of critical instructions so you are
      not blocked by a flaky network.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card guide-section">
    <h2>Checklist to run before each study week</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm your default voice still sounds natural after any OS updates.</li>
      <li>Test the keyboard shortcuts after reopening the browser.</li>
      <li>Prepare a fresh page in your notes app labeled with the course and week number.</li>
      <li>Bookmark the <a href="../guides/tts-study-loop-templates.html">study loop templates</a> you plan to use.</li>
      <li>Charge headphones and keep a wired pair as backup to avoid Bluetooth dropouts.</li>
    </ul>
