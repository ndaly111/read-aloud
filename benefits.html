  <h1>Benefits of Read‑Aloud</h1>
  <p class="lead">Browser-based text-to-speech removes friction for students, writers, and anyone who needs to hear their words. Here is what you gain by using Read‑Aloud.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Better comprehension in less time</h2>
    <p>
      Listening forces you to process sentences at a steady pace. With Read‑Aloud you can keep the
      progress meter visible, pause to take notes, and resume without losing place. Many students report
      they retain more from a 15-minute listen than from 30 minutes of silent skimming because audio
      keeps wandering eyes in check.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Hands-free review when you need it</h2>
    <p>
      Because everything runs in the browser, you can prop up a laptop or phone and listen while
      stretching, organizing flashcards, or commuting. The <a href="/app.html">tool</a> works offline once
      loaded, and keyboard shortcuts make it easy to pause or resume without grabbing the mouse.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Accessibility without extra logins</h2>
    <p>
      Read‑Aloud uses system voices already on your device, so there is no account to manage and no cloud
      upload. That keeps the experience compliant with many classroom and workplace privacy policies.
      You can still customize pacing, language, and voice quality without installing extensions.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Support for different learning styles</h2>
    <p>
      The tool pairs well with dual reading, focus timers, and proofreading by ear. Explore the
      <a href="/guides.html">guides library</a> to see workflows for ADHD, dyslexia, language practice,
      and writing. Each guide shows how to combine Read‑Aloud with simple checklists so you can get value
      without new software.
