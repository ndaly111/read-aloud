  <p>
    Read‑Aloud is designed to keep most work on your device. Once the page and voices are loaded, many browsers can continue speaking even when your connection is weak or temporarily offline. This guide explains what to expect, how to test your setup, and what to do when playback stops.
  </p>

  <div class="note"><strong>Expectation setting:</strong> Offline behavior depends on the voices installed on your device and how your browser caches the page. Test before you need it.</div>

  <h2>What works offline</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>System voices:</strong> Voices provided by your OS or browser typically remain available without a connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Cached page:</strong> If you load <a href="index.html">read-aloud.com</a> before going offline, the controls often keep working until you close the tab.</li>
    <li><strong>Local text:</strong> Your pasted text is already on your device, so playback does not require uploads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What may require a connection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Loading new voices that need an initial download.</li>
    <li>Analytics or ads (if enabled) may not load offline, which is fine for playback.</li>
    <li>Refreshing the page or opening a new device may need connectivity to fetch assets again.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Testing too late:</strong> Verify offline capability before travel or exams.</li>
    <li><strong>Closing the tab:</strong> If you close the tab offline, you might not reopen it until you reconnect.</li>
    <li><strong>Overloading text:</strong> Large pastes can strain devices with limited memory. Break text into smaller chunks as suggested in the <a href="guide-reading-long-documents.html">long documents guide</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring battery:</strong> Offline use can drain battery faster if your screen stays awake. Keep a charger handy.</li>
    <li><strong>Switching networks mid-playback:</strong> Some browsers pause audio when connectivity changes. If that happens, stop and restart playback.</li>
    <li><strong>Assuming all voices work offline:</strong> Some premium voices require an active connection. Test the exact voice you plan to use.</li>
    <li><strong>No backup plan:</strong> Keep a second browser installed or a plain-text copy of your material ready in case a cached tab fails.</li>
    <li><strong>Forgetting privacy basics:</strong> Clear the text box after you finish, especially on shared devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Preflight checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the <a href="index.html">home page</a> and <a href="help.html">Help page</a> are open before going offline.</li>
    <li>Test your chosen voice at two speeds (normal and slightly slower) to confirm stability.</li>
    <li>Prepare 2–3 text chunks (300–500 words each) in a notes app so you can paste quickly without searching files.</li>
    <li>Lower your screen brightness and close background apps to conserve battery during long offline stretches.</li>
    <li>Write down a quick recovery plan: reconnect, reload, switch browser, or switch voice if playback fails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>While online, open <a href="index.html">read-aloud.com</a> and load the <a href="help.html">Help page</a> for troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>Paste a 300-word sample and play it at 1.0x. Confirm the voice sounds normal.</li>
    <li>Disable Wi‑Fi or disconnect from the network. Keep the tab open.</li>
    <li>Play the sample again. If it works, try a second sample at a different speed.</li>
    <li>If playback fails offline, reconnect, reload the page, and test again. Consider a different browser or voice.</li>
    <li>For long trips, repeat this test the day before you travel so you know exactly which device/browser combo is reliable.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Troubleshooting steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No sound:</strong> Toggle pause/play, check hardware volume, and try a shorter text chunk. If still silent, reconnect briefly and reload.</li>
    <li><strong>Playback stops mid-way:</strong> Reduce text size, close other tabs, and switch to a simpler voice.</li>
    <li><strong>Missing voices after reboot:</strong> Reopen Read‑Aloud while online to refresh the voice list, then retest offline.</li>
    <li><strong>Battery anxiety:</strong> Lower screen brightness and disable unused radios (Bluetooth, GPS) if safe to do so.</li>
    <li><strong>Need more help:</strong> Review the <a href="help.html">Help</a> page or the <a href="guides.html">guides hub</a> for workflow ideas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Does Read‑Aloud store my text?</strong> No. Your text stays in the tab.</li>
    <li><strong>Why did voices disappear offline?</strong> Some voices are streamed. Stick with default system voices for offline use.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I use this on mobile?</strong> Yes, but keep the screen awake to prevent playback pauses. See the <a href="guide-adhd-focus-routines.html">focus routines guide</a> for attention tips.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I handle long sessions?</strong> Combine this guide with the <a href="guide-study-pomodoro.html">Pomodoro workflow</a> so breaks are built in.</li>
    <li><strong>What if I change devices?</strong> Retest on the new device while online. Voice quality and availability differ across systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I cache multiple guides?</strong> Yes. Open <a href="guides.html">guides</a> you need before going offline so their content is available for reference.</li>
    <li><strong>Is there a best browser?</strong> Desktop Chrome/Edge often have the most reliable offline voices, but test whatever you plan to use.</li>
  </ul>
