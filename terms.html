  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 14, 2025</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Plain‑English summary:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Read‑Aloud is provided “as is” with no guarantees.</li>
      <li>You’re responsible for the text you paste and for using the site lawfully.</li>
      <li>Use text you have the rights to use (don’t use the site to violate copyright or other laws).</li>
      <li>We may update the site and these terms over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Acceptance of these Terms</h2>
  <p>
    By accessing or using <strong>read-aloud.com</strong> (“Read‑Aloud”, “we”, “us”), you agree to these Terms of Use.
    If you do not agree, do not use the site.
  </p>

  <h2>2) What Read‑Aloud is</h2>
  <p>
    Read‑Aloud is a browser-based text‑to‑speech tool. You paste or type text, then your browser/operating system speaks it aloud.
    The tool is intended for general use cases such as studying, proofreading, accessibility support, and language practice.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Your responsibilities (important)</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>

      <li><strong>No illegal use.</strong> Do not use Read‑Aloud for unlawful activity or to violate anyone’s rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Be careful with sensitive information.</strong> Avoid pasting passwords, private identifiers, or confidential material—especially on shared devices or while screen‑sharing.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow your organization’s rules.</strong> If you use Read‑Aloud at school or work, make sure it’s allowed by your policies.</li>

  </div>

  <h2>4) Prohibited conduct</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Attempt to bypass security or access non-public parts of the site or hosting infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Use the site to distribute malware, exploit code, or harmful content.</li>
    <li>Misrepresent your identity or affiliation when contacting support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Intellectual property</h2>

    The Read‑Aloud website, its design, and original content (excluding third‑party libraries and your pasted text) are owned by Read‑Aloud or its operator
    and protected by applicable laws. You may use the site for its intended purpose, but you may not copy or republish the site’s original content
    except as allowed by law or with permission.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    Read‑Aloud may include open-source components (for example, an offline fallback voice engine). Those components are governed by their respective licenses.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Third‑party links, donations, and affiliate links</h2>
  <p>
    Read‑Aloud may link to third‑party websites and services (for example, donation platforms or product pages).
    We do not control third‑party sites and are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some links may be affiliate links that help support the site.</p>

  <h2>7) Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Read‑Aloud may display ads at some times and not at others (for example, depending on approval status, configuration, or region).
    If ads are enabled, they may be served by third‑party providers and subject to their policies.

  </p>

  <h2>8) Availability and changes to the service</h2>
  <p>
    We may modify, suspend, or discontinue Read‑Aloud (or any part of it) at any time, including features, appearance, and supported behaviors.
    We do not guarantee that the site will always be available or error‑free.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <p style="margin-top:0">
      Read‑Aloud is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong> basis without warranties of any kind,
