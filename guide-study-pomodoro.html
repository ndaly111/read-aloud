  <h1>Study With Pomodoro and Read‑Aloud</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>
    The Pomodoro Technique breaks work into focused sprints separated by short rests. Pairing Pomodoro with Read‑Aloud keeps you listening actively without drifting into passive consumption. You’ll set a timer, define a purpose for each block, and close with a tiny recap so the material sticks.
  </p>

  <div class="callout"><strong>Baseline setup:</strong> 25 minutes of listening and note-taking, 5 minutes of break. After four rounds, take a longer 15–20 minute pause.</div>

  <h2>Before you start</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick a quiet spot and a comfortable voice. If you’re new to text-to-speech, start at 0.95x–1.05x speed.</li>
    <li>Prepare two documents: your source text and a scratch pad for notes. Using a simple note app keeps friction low.</li>
    <li>Decide on an outcome for the next sprint: summarize a chapter, pull quotes, or outline flashcards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Running a Pomodoro block</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Set a 25-minute timer. Many people keep the timer visible near the Read‑Aloud controls.</li>
    <li>Paste a chunk of text and click <strong>Start</strong>. Listen actively—highlight phrases or pause with the <a href="/guide-keyboard-shortcuts.html">keyboard shortcuts</a> when something stands out.</li>
    <li>At minute 12–15, slow the speed slightly if you feel focus sliding. At minute 20, capture two sentences of summary in your own words.</li>
    <li>When the timer ends, stop playback and take a 5-minute break away from the screen. Stand up, stretch, drink water.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Letting breaks disappear:</strong> Skipping rests turns Pomodoro into a marathon. Protect the 5-minute gap so your ears recover.</li>
    <li><strong>Using one giant paste:</strong> Huge blocks make it hard to know where you left off. Keep sections short, as suggested in the <a href="/guide-reading-long-documents.html">long documents guide</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>No clear goal:</strong> Define “done” for each sprint. Examples: finish two sections, write four bullet points, or identify three terms to research.</li>
    <li><strong>Only listening:</strong> Passive listening leads to low retention. Pair audio with quick notes or verbal summaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring fatigue cues:</strong> If you catch yourself rewinding often, shorten the sprint to 15–20 minutes and drop speed slightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping a warmup:</strong> A 2-minute skim of headings before starting audio helps your brain predict what is coming next.</li>
    <li><strong>Staying in one posture:</strong> Change position between blocks—stand, sit, or stretch—to avoid associating fatigue with the material.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Block 1: Introduction at 1.0x. Write four bullets.</li>
    <li>Break: 5 minutes, away from the screen.</li>
    <li>Block 2: Methods at 0.95x. Highlight steps that need diagrams. Note timestamps if you pause.</li>
    <li>Block 3: Results at 1.1x. Pause after each subsection to summarize in one line.</li>
    <li>Long break: 15 minutes. Then return for a final recap where you paste your notes back into Read‑Aloud to hear them aloud.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Adjusting timer lengths</h2>
  <p>
    Pomodoro is flexible. If you have ADHD or fatigue from screen time, experiment with 15/5 sprints to keep momentum high, then extend to 30/7 once you build endurance. For dense legal or technical sections, align timers with natural document breaks so you finish a subsection before resting. Use the <a href="/guide-adhd-focus-routines.html">focus routines guide</a> for more environmental tweaks and pair them with reliable playback tips from <a href="/guide-offline-use.html">offline use</a> when you switch devices.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection block</h2>
  <p>
    After two or three Pomodoro cycles, reserve one block for reflection instead of new content. Paste your notes back into Read‑Aloud, listen at 0.9x, and look for gaps. Add a short checklist from the <a href="/guide-proofreading-checklist.html">proofreading checklist</a> if you are editing writing, or create flashcards for key terms. Reflection blocks prevent endless consumption and turn listening into action.
  </p>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Is 25/5 the only option?</strong> No. Try 20/5 for intense material or 30/7 for lighter reading. Keep breaks non-negotiable.</li>
    <li><strong>What if my browser sleeps?</strong> Reduce power-saving settings or use desktop. For tips, read <a href="/guide-offline-use.html">offline & reliability</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I combine this with focus techniques?</strong> Pair with the routines in <a href="/guide-adhd-focus-routines.html">ADHD-friendly focus</a> for environment tweaks.</li>
    <li><strong>How much text per block?</strong> Aim for 600–900 words. Adjust downward for technical writing.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I use Pomodoro for language learning?</strong> Yes. Alternate between listening and shadowing at slower speeds, then recap with the <a href="/guide-language-shadowing.html">language shadowing guide</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>What if I share a device?</strong> Keep your pasted text minimal and clear it after each session. Review privacy notes on the <a href="/help.html">Help</a> page.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I recover if I miss a timer?</strong> Treat the next block as a reset: re-skim headings, choose a smaller chunk, and restart with a fresh 15–20 minute sprint.</li>
  </ul>
