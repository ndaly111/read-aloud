  <h1>Language Shadowing With Read‑Aloud</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>
    Shadowing is the practice of listening to a model speaker and repeating immediately afterward. Read‑Aloud lets you build low-friction shadowing drills using voices available on your device. The steps below focus on clarity and repetition without adding external apps or recordings.
  </p>

  <div class="tip"><strong>Keep it short:</strong> 2–4 sentences per loop are ideal. Repeat the same snippet several times before moving on.</div>

  <h2>Pick material and voices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Select short, clear sentences from your target language—news leads, textbook dialogs, or your own writing.</li>
    <li>Choose a native-accent voice if available. If not, pick the clearest option and adjust speed to match the speaker you want to imitate.</li>
    <li>If a voice sounds robotic, try another browser as suggested in <a href="/guide-browser-compatibility.html">browser compatibility</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Build the shadowing loop</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Paste 2–4 sentences into Read‑Aloud and set speed between 0.9x–1.0x.</li>
    <li>Listen once without speaking. On the second play, whisper along. On the third, speak at full volume.</li>
    <li>Repeat the loop 3–5 times until pronunciation feels smooth. Focus on rhythm and intonation, not just individual words.</li>
    <li>Increase speed slightly (1.05x–1.15x) to push your pacing, then return to normal speed to reinforce clarity.</li>
    <li>Record yourself briefly (if you’re comfortable) and compare to the model voice. Note one improvement for the next round.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Using long paragraphs:</strong> Shadowing needs short loops. Large blocks reduce repetition.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping listening-only passes:</strong> Hearing the cadence first makes your speech smoother.</li>
    <li><strong>Going too fast too soon:</strong> Start slow. Speed comes after you master pronunciation.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring stress patterns:</strong> Pay attention to syllable stress and pauses. Use a slower speed to feel the rhythm.</li>
    <li><strong>No breaks:</strong> Vocal fatigue is real. Take water breaks every 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Monotone delivery:</strong> If you sound flat, mimic the voice’s intonation explicitly—rise and fall with the model.</li>
    <li><strong>Practicing only one accent:</strong> Try two voices to expose yourself to different stress patterns and speeds.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping self-checks:</strong> Record a 10-second clip and compare it to the model so you can target one improvement per loop.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pronunciation and rhythm drills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chunk by phrase:</strong> Add slashes (/) between phrases before pasting so you hear natural pauses.</li>
    <li><strong>Accent focus:</strong> Choose one sound (like “th” or rolled “r”) per session and exaggerate it for clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>Call-and-response:</strong> Paste a question and answer pair, then alternate voices to hear dialogue cadence.</li>
    <li><strong>Stress marking:</strong> Bold or uppercase stressed syllables in your pasted text to remind yourself where to emphasize.</li>
    <li><strong>Shadow then retell:</strong> After a few loops, close your eyes and retell the sentences in your own words to check comprehension.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a short news paragraph and break it into three sentences.</li>
    <li>Run a loop at 0.95x: listen once, whisper once, then speak at full volume.</li>
    <li>Raise speed to 1.1x for one repetition, then drop back to 1.0x to reinforce accuracy.</li>
    <li>Paste your own sentence that uses new vocabulary and shadow it twice to own the phrasing.</li>
    <li>Finish by reading your notes back through Read‑Aloud so you hear your personalized examples.</li>
    <li>Repeat the same set the next day at a slightly faster speed, focusing on one pronunciation target you noted.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Can I do this offline?</strong> Often yes. Load the page while online, then see <a href="/guide-offline-use.html">offline tips</a> for reliability and limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Which speed is best?</strong> Start at 0.9x–1.0x. Increase only when pronunciation is comfortable.</li>
    <li><strong>How many loops per day?</strong> 10–20 minutes of focused loops beats one long session. Stop if your voice tires.</li>
    <li><strong>What if the voice mispronounces?</strong> Try another browser or device. You can also adjust spelling slightly to encourage clearer pronunciation.</li>
    <li><strong>Do I need headphones?</strong> They help you hear detail and block noise, but keep volume safe to avoid fatigue.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I track progress?</strong> Keep a short log of phrases practiced and one improvement noted per day. Revisit the log weekly.</li>
