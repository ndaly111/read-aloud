  <h1>Proofreading by Ear Checklist</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>
    Listening to your writing exposes mistakes your eyes skim past. Read‑Aloud makes it easy to hear pacing, rhythm, and missing transitions. Use this checklist as a repeatable process: prep the text, run two listening passes, and finish with a quick style sweep so your document is ready to share.
  </p>

  <div class="tip"><strong>Prep tip:</strong> Use a clear voice at ~1.0x for the first pass, then switch to a contrasting voice and slightly slower speed for the second pass to catch different issues.</div>

  <h2>Checklist</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Clean formatting:</strong> Remove double spaces, fix broken line breaks, and ensure punctuation is consistent.</li>
    <li><strong>Read‑through for flow:</strong> Listen at 1.0x and note awkward phrasing, repeated words, and places where you stumble.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity check:</strong> Highlight sentences with more than two commas. Simplify or split them.</li>
    <li><strong>Names and numbers:</strong> Confirm spelling of names, units, and dates. Listen slowly (0.9x) through lists or tables.</li>
    <li><strong>Headings and transitions:</strong> Make sure each section starts with a clear heading and that paragraphs connect logically.</li>
    <li><strong>Final consistency pass:</strong> Switch to a second voice and listen again, focusing on tone and style. Check that tense, capitalization, and terminology are consistent.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Skipping the slow pass:</strong> Fast listening hides missing articles and small typos.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring headings:</strong> Without clear headings, your reader loses context. Add them before your final listen.</li>
    <li><strong>Using only one device:</strong> If possible, do one pass on desktop and another on mobile to hear different voice behaviors.</li>
    <li><strong>No break between passes:</strong> Take at least five minutes away so you can hear the text fresh on the second run.</li>
    <li><strong>Not testing links:</strong> If your document has links, click a few while listening to ensure they work and make sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaving placeholders:</strong> Tags like “TK” or “@@” vanish during listening. Search and replace them before your final pass.</li>
    <li><strong>Forgetting numbers and units:</strong> Measurements often hide typos. Listen slowly through lists of numbers and confirm units match.</li>
    <li><strong>Letting jargon pile up:</strong> If you hear three unfamiliar terms in one paragraph, rewrite for clarity or add a short definition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Style and clarity checks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sentence length:</strong> Mark any sentence that takes more than one breath to read aloud. Split or simplify.</li>
    <li><strong>Voice consistency:</strong> Ensure first/second/third person stays consistent within a section.</li>
    <li><strong>Tone alignment:</strong> If the audio sounds abrupt between sections, add a short transition phrase.</li>
    <li><strong>List hygiene:</strong> Check parallel structure in bullet lists. Listening makes mismatched verbs obvious.</li>
    <li><strong>Reference hygiene:</strong> Call out figures and tables before discussing them so listeners know context.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Paste your draft into Read‑Aloud. Choose a neutral voice at 1.0x and listen while adding margin notes.</li>
    <li>Rewrite any confusing sentences and fix typos you spotted.</li>
    <li>Switch to a different voice at 0.9x. Listen again, focusing on headings and transitions.</li>
    <li>Paste your final version once more and listen at 1.1x for pacing. Stop whenever the rhythm feels rushed.</li>
    <li>Run a quick checklist against your style guide: tone, capitalization, and link accuracy.</li>
    <li>Do a final micro-pass on numbers, names, and dates by slowing to 0.85x. This is where small typos usually hide.</li>
    <li>Save a short “author’s note” by pasting your key revisions into Read‑Aloud so you can replay them before publishing.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Which voice should I use?</strong> Start with a clear neutral voice. Then try a second voice for your final pass. See the <a href="/guide-best-voice-speed.html">voice and speed guide</a> for tuning.</li>
    <li><strong>How long should the text be per pass?</strong> 400–800 words keeps the context fresh. For longer pieces, split into sections as in the <a href="/guide-reading-long-documents.html">long documents guide</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Do I need special tools?</strong> No. Read‑Aloud runs in your browser. Use a simple note app for corrections and check <a href="/help.html">Help</a> if playback stalls.</li>
    <li><strong>Can this help with resumes?</strong> Yes. Listening exposes jargon and run-on sentences. Add a <a href="/guide-keyboard-shortcuts.html">shortcut</a> for quick pausing while you edit.</li>
    <li><strong>Should I listen on mobile?</strong> Mobile is fine for short pieces; for long edits, desktop is smoother. Compare both if you can.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I share feedback?</strong> After listening, paste your bullet notes into a shared doc. Link teammates to the <a href="/guides.html">guides page</a> so they can repeat the process.</li>
    <li><strong>What if I’m short on time?</strong> Do a single 0.95x pass focused on headings, numbers, and calls to action. Plan a deeper review later using the <a href="/guide-study-pomodoro.html">Pomodoro workflow</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="tip">
    Keep improving your editing routine in the <a href="/guides.html">guides hub</a>. Pair this checklist with the broader <a href="/guide-proofread.html">proofreading guide</a> or combine with the <a href="/guide-study-pomodoro.html">Pomodoro workflow</a> to prevent fatigue during revisions.
